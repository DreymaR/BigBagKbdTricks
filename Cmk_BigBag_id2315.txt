[h]DREYMAR'S: DreymaR's Extensive Yet Modular ARSenal for typing![/h]

[i][CAVEAT EMPTOR: This work is under some long-term construction due to its complexity.[/i]

This is the [b]Big Bag of Keyboard Tricks Main Topic[/b], in which I go into detail on what the different tricks are.

I also have topics focusing on different implementations of the Big Bag Of Keyboard Tricks:

Since I started using Colemak in early 2007 I've been fiddling with it, trying out ideas from the forum and adding some of my own. Colemak [i]per se[/i] is to me only the letter block mappings including the semicolon, and their shifted counterparts. I've always ended up with that intact and it has stood the test of time. If you look up the "ergo" mods below you'll see that I'm somewhat flexible about the geometry – but in reality that's about the physical keyboard design and a better hand position for me. The layout itself stays mostly the same!

And so, [i]voila[/i], here it is:

[b][–.–][/b] [b]Done/Todo[/b]


I use Farkas Máté's excellent Portable Keyboard Layout ('PKL') to achieve most of the above for Windows but over the years I've been using Linux (Ubuntu and others) more and more. So I hacked up a bunch of modifications to the X.Org XKB files. Then I got me a USB-2-USB "QUICKIE" converter and implemented much of my tricks for that too. I'm pretty proud of it all, I must say! :)

An advantage with my implementation is that in most cases you can pick and choose most of the enhancements as modules:
• The Angle/Wide mods are keyboard models so they work with any layout you choose (including QWERTY or Dvorak ones) and may be chosen per user
• The Extend layers and their switch key are "options" and should work with nearly any existing layout
• The locale/phonetic, Mirrored and Tarmak layouts are separate layouts that may use various chooser keys as desired
Freedom of choice through modularity is an ideal in the DreymaR world, as in Linux.


[h]DONE:[/h]
• Updated Rulemak and Bulmak to 2016 versions ([b]ru/by/ua, bg/rs/mk[/b] – although only found in [b]ru[/b] and [b]bg[/b] so far):
    East Slavic (Russian/Church/Belarus/Ukraina?) & South Slavic (Bulgarian/ISO-9/Serbia(Cyrillic)/Macedonia?)
• Tarmak layouts for Curl modders. The changes are minor, but should be easily accessible for the newcomer.
• Get this up and going on GitHub.


[h]TODO:[/h]
• Present the Big Bag more hypertextually on GitHub gh-pages. (I know, I'm slow at this...)
• Dead keys with currency on AltGr+4, Greek on AltGr+5, tech/math stuff on AltGr+= and IPA++ on AltGr+Shift+numbers(?) [done in PKL]
• A total of 4 Extend layers!? Proposals: Basic/nav/edit, NumPad++, Coding/etc, Hotstrings
• Modifier keys for 4 Extend layers. For instance, Caps+{--, LAlt, RAlt, LAlt+RAlt}. Holding Caps or Alt down should maintain the layer state.
• For some (or all?) Extend layers, a Lock (say, Shift+Alt+Caps locks; tapping Caps releases)?
• Fix the Hebrew phonetic ("Hebmak") layout, once we agree on how! (With [user]wrapman[/user] and whoever's interested.)
• Develop and test a [url=https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2389-vietnamese-colemak/]Vietnamese Colemak[/url] (with [user]IceDryst[/user] and whoever's interested).
• More locale variants: [b]epo[/b] (Esperanto), …? (Any suggestions, or comments on the existing ones?)


[h]LASTLY:[/h]
• Best of luck with Colemak and its many marvelous mods! ^_^
• If you do get stuck, here's a little [b][url=https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2157-joking-around/]light entertainment[/url][/b] to hopefully Shift your mo(o)d. ;-)

Colemak's connected to the ... Curl* mod,
The Curl mod's connected to the ... Angle mod,
The Wide mod's connected to the ... shoulder bones,
And Extend's just wonderful!

[b]I'm gonna be the man who types a lot today[/b]
[b]When I go out, yeah, I know I'm gonna be[/b]

[h]Typing training with Tristesse's Amphetype[/h]

I've noticed that I kept reposting this tip over the years, so here's a topic on it. :-)

[b][url=https://github.com/webiest/amphetype]Amphetype by Tristesse[/url][/b] is a brilliant cross-platform typing trainer. It can be used for leisurely typing texts or for intensive focused training sessions, as you like. It's flexible and informative – especially for a one-man project – and it's free. I have its database in my Dropbox so I can use it from anywhere.

Amphetype hasn't been developed in a long time, but it works without any problems and many people use it to this day.

I like using a largish font (Cambria Italic 22) and subtle colors that don't annoy the hell out of me:
[code]
• Correct   text – #000000 (RGB   0,  0,  0)
• Correct   back – #eeeeee (RGB 238,238,238)
• Incorrect text – #660000 (RGB 102,  0,  0)
• Incorrect back – #aaaaaa (RGB 170,170,170)
[/code]

When opening Amphetype in Windows, I usually press Alt+Space then X to maximize its window (or use the mouse like a muggle if you wish).


[h]“Type-reading”[/h]
I usually get a book as a text file from [b][url=https://www.gutenberg.org/]Project Gutenberg[/url][/b] or similar, and put it into Amphetype. Experiment a little with how large text chunks you want to use (I like between 300 and 900 characters). This is brilliant for getting a lot of typing mileage. I've "read" Machiavelli that way, as well as Alice Through The Looking Glass, some Lovecraft and a 19th century lewd English book! ;-)

For racking up mileage by type-reading books, I recommend not using too strict parameters so you won't have to type the same page again very often. Your average speed -10 WPM and 97% accuracy is a good starting point. You set the limits on the Sources tab, while selecting what text/lesson to type next. I turn off the need to press SPACE before each lesson, so I can type fluently. The timer doesn't start until you start typing a page, so take your time before diving in if you want to.

Further inspiration: Maybe you want to learn lyrics or poems by heart? Of course, type-reading isn't the optimal way of enjoying poetry but can be a hard-hitting combo if you want to repeat a verse many times anyway! Maybe Kipling's "If" will sort out both your wisdom and typing skills at the same time!? Or maybe something motivational is to your tastes? Feel free to use the song I made at the top of this post... ;-)

A slight caveat: If your layout doesn't support special glyphs, make sure your text doesn't have them. The book I'm currently typing about Greek and Roman mythology, has some old-fashioned spellings like [i]Æsculap[/i] and [i]Aïdes[/i]. For my Colemak[eD] that's no problem at all of course, but beware if you aren't used to it. The Amphetype fork has an option to clean out anything non-trivial I think, but I haven't used it.

[h]Focused lessons[/h]
Below is a brilliant post that I've quoted several times [with an edit or two by me], on generating Amphetype training lessons to focus on hard or common words. It's from a topic called [b][url=https://forum.colemak.com/topic/1047-lessons-for-colemak-beginners/]Lessons For Colemak Beginners[/url][/b], in which there are lots of other lessons you can use as well.

[quote=Nimbostratue (2011)]

[b]Generating typing training lessons in Amphetype[/b]

Here is how to practice the 1000 most common words lesson in an effective way.

I place the 1000 words in Amphetype and use settings that will generate lines of text like this:
   the of to the of to the of to and a in and a in and a in is it you is it
   you is it you that he was that he was that he was

I set the program to allow me to keep practicing until I reach a certain desired accuracy and speed (see below).
When I pass this threshold I am allowed to continue to type the next 2 lines from the 1000 words.
In this way I learn the layout and practice the common words and bigrams (th,st,nt,ou,io,ea, etc) at the same time.

In fact I do not type the 1000 words most of the time. What I type is the first 130 to 150 words [or whatever suits you].
Then I start again from the beginning and increase the threshold by an extra +10 WPM.

In theory and my practice (I have tried this method with over 20 layouts) you should be able to advance every day by 6-10 WPM until 50 WPM. Once I practiced for only 2 hours every day using this method, and I was advancing 6+ WPM each day. So you do not need to spend too much time typing in the beginning when you learn a layout. You should focus on increasing your muscle memory for the common bigrams and common words, which will help you increase your speed quickly. This way will not train you for individual keys, it will train you for common bigrams and you will notice that you become much faster at typing bigrams than remembering key positions, but with the other lessons in my lessons thread you can improve on this. I usually use this method exclusively until I reach 28-30 WPM and then I start the other lengthy lessons in the lessons thread.


[b]Amphetype settings:[/b]

[b]1) On the Preferences tab[/b] set "Try to limit text and lesson to between 100 and 100 characters".

[b]2) On the Lesson Generator tab[/b]:
   "In generating lessons, I will make 3 copies of the list below and divide them into sublists of size 3"
   The program will create either a single or multiple copies of each word interleaved according to the selection made.

   For example if you pasted the text "about the it" and chose copies/size (I usually chose 3,3 or 3,4) you get:
      2,3 --> about the it about the it
      2,1 --> about about the the it it

   Paste in the 1000 words (below), name the lesson at the bottom and click "Add to Sources" to save it.

[b]3) On the Sources tab[/b] set "Repeat texts that don't meet the following requirements:"
      WPM              your average speed (e.g., for 2 min at hi-games) + 10 WPM
      Accuracy         99 or 100% [or 98% if it bothers you – but accuracy is important for typing flow!]
   Set the lesson fields to the same values.

   Select to get new lessons "In Order".

   Choose your lesson from the Sources pane on the left and double-click on it to start typing.
   Keep typing each lesson until you pass the threshold. Do not hit Esc to skip any lines.

Furthermore, you can let Amphetype generate a list of your "most damaging" (or slowest, most mistyped etc.) words or trigrams, and send them to the Lesson Generator! I recommend editing out rare words before making the lessons themselves so you don't risk training words like 'Cthulhu' and 'Shub-Niggurath' a lot, but otherwise this is very useful once you've racked up some mileage in your database.

Apparently, after typing a book about Graeco-Roman mythology for a while, Amphetype suggested this amusing list of words for me; I just sorted it and added punctuation:

[b]They that were called under & into Hera/Zeus' order, have this beautiful form from their king/wife gods – with which their being became overly beautiful.[/b]

Really, that was my list of "most damaging" words – rearranged but complete. Heh! A truly divine typing task. :-)

On a side note, I don't trust the "viscosity" measure 100%, as I don't fully understand its implications. Tristesse feels that an even typing flow is holy if I understand him right, but we know that the best typists do speed up for familiar words and elements and brake down for the trickier ones. Ergo, the best typists in the world choose to have "bad viscosity" to some extent? Hmmm....! I still use the "most damaging" stat to select words though as it seems to be the most balanced measure.

User [user]bph[/user] has tried starting with the 1000 most common words and after a few runs through them, [url=https://forum.colemak.com/post/19614/#p19614]generating a lesson of, say, the 200 most damaging ones[/url]! That's clever, and will make you train only words that are both common and hard for you.

In [url=https://forum.colemak.com/post/19132/#p19132]a forum post by misterW[/url], he suggests a focus on common and damaging n-grams. I quite agree with that!

[quote=misterW (lightly edited)]
Typing is all about grouping chunks of characters together and into your memory. Grab a list of the most common words and n-grams: [b]'the', 'and', 'with', 'that', 'tion', 'ing', 'for'[/b]. You want to be typing those extremely fast. Roll your fingers whenever possible. You want to commit these chunks into memory. You could think of it as, "I'm going to become the best in the world at typing the word [i]different[/i]."

What would you need to do to accomplish that? You need to practice it until it becomes second nature that you don't even have to think about it. Visualization helps. When away from the keyboard, visualize in your mind where the keys are and what fingers you will use to type the word "that" or whatever word you struggle with.

[...]

Don't practice full paragraphs that you struggle with. Practice small words or phrases, one at a time. So if you want to learn the [b]'tion'[/b] 4-gram, just keep practicing that. Then add a leading letter: [b]'ation', 'etion', 'ition', 'otion', 'ution', 'ption'[/b], get fast and comfortable with all of those combinations. Then try full words: [b]'station', 'motion', 'fruition'[/b]. You'll notice that the start of those words you haven't practiced, so you will be slow for the first few letters, and then you'll speed through the 'tion' part that you practiced. That's good.

Practice it every day. If your hands get tired, take a break and freshen your mind by trying a new combination, say [b]'ent'[/b]. Then [b]'went'[/b], then [b]'enter'[/b], progressing to [b]'movement'[/b].
[/quote]

Here are a couple of sample lists for focusing on n-grams. Feel free to add your favourites below! ;-)

etc etc...

If you want to be thorough, you can check out lists like [url]http://www.wordfind.com/starts-with/the/[/url] or [url]http://www.morewords.com/starts-with/the/[/url] – but I suppose the most bang-for-buck will be earned by training the most common of those words.

Also, here's another [b][url=https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english]list of common words[/url][/b] from Google Research ([url=https://forum.colemak.com/post/19141/#p19141]thanks, misterW![/url]). You can filter it by n-grams, for instance.

[h]Notes:[/h]
• The experts all seem to value the ability to vary your speed. Type well-known words blazingly fast, and slow down a bit for hard ones to avoid mistakes.
• Mistakes will slow you down more than consciously slowing down will, once you get used to it!
• Good training should be varied! Don't wear yourself out by banging your head against a hurdle until you're exhausted, but keep chipping away at it now and then.
• I think that many shorter bouts in a day beats a few long ones.
• You can of course use the above mentioned lesson lists with other training tools such as [url=https://forum.colemak.com/post/7664/#p7664]TypeFaster[/url], if you like.
• If you want to see lesson statistics on the Analysis tab, you'll have to select "Save key/trigram/word statistics from generated lessons" on the Preferences tab.
• Whether training or just typing, I try to make a point of deleting the whole word if I make a mistake; Extend helps with that (Ext+T+O for Ctrl+Back).
    This can sometimes be faster than mashing the Back key, but more importantly it lets you type the word correctly before proceeding. That should help in the long run.


[h]Online Training Tools:[/h]
I've compiled a little list of other typing tests/trainers that I like and use:
[b][url=https://forum.colemak.com/post/20413/#p20413]The Typing of The Dead[/url][/b] is an immensely fun game described in my Other Typing Tricks post. Have a gander!
[b][url=https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english]10FastFingers[/url][/b] has a very smooth and enjoyable test with some flexibility like typing your own text.
[b][url=http://play.typeracer.com/]TypeRacer[/url][/b] is another classic for speed training. There's even an Instant Death mode that trains accuracy ruthlessly!
[b][url=http://www.rapidtyping.com/online-typing-games/fast-typer-2.html]Fast Typer 2[/url][/b] is a hoot, as you train both speed and accuracy very ... fast, indeed.
[b][url=https://www.speedtypingonline.com/typing-test]Speed Typing Online[/url][/b] has a fun little test in which you type text quotes and lyrics.

On the [b][url=https://colemak.com/Learn]Colemak Learn page[/url][/b], there's a list of several tests and trainers, if you want to browse around for more.
[b][url=https://sense-lang.org/trial/typing/tutor/EN_colemak_tutorial.php]Sense-Lang[/url][/b] has Colemak lessons, but unfortunately no ergo mods like Curl(DH).
[b][url=http://www.keybr.com/practice]Keybr[/url][/b] is used by many it seems. It's a rather no-nonsense online trainer.
[b][url=https://www.keyhero.com/]Key Hero[/url][/b] is a nice online solution. It's written by a Colemak user, records progress and focuses on realistic learning.
[b][url=https://thetypingcat.com/]The Typing Cat[/url][/b] also seems nice. Nice kitty! =^.^=

This may come too late for you since you're here reading my training page, but:
If you're new to Colemak and didn't opt for the [b][url=https://forum.colemak.com/topic/1858-learn-colemak-in-steps-with-the-tarmak-layouts/]Tarmak[/url][/b] experience, then maybe [b][url=https://github.com/first20hours/keyzen-colemak]KeyZen for Colemak[/url][/b] could work for you?
It lets you learn by simply doing in the here and now, without stress. Om, Om! _/|\_

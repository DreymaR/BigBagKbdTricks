I've rewritten the whole Tarmak presentation because the original topics were a mess by now. In these next posts I go into more detail about analysis, naming and history.


[h]TARMAK ANALYSIS[/h]

Here is some analysis of Tarmak, using analysis programs available online. Keep in mind though, that such analyzers are only as good as their design. The maker of CodeSharp (and the Workman layout) for instance, feels that the Colemak D and H positions are very bad for him, and that hand alternation is a lot better than finger rolls. I don't agree with those weightings, and feel that same-finger bigrams are a lot worse; these are more common in the Workman layout than in Colemak and I think that's a bad idea. Be that as it may, the tools take into consideration many important parameters and seem to be well designed as such.

The following analysis was done by user Cevgar in 2011 using the CodeSharp analyzer. This tool seems to be no longer available online after the Workman layout moved to a new site?

This graphic shows the number of keys that each successive layout step changes, with the Workman and Dvorak layouts included as "further steps" after Colemak since they change 21 and 33 of the 35 letter block keys. The line in the graph represents how much "effort reduction per key" you gain for each step of more moved keys. Think of it as "bang for buck" if you will!

This was done for the older Tarmak(ETOIR) steps, but the results are very similar for the new one.

The "effort reduction per key" was assessed using the "overall effort" percentage from the CodeSharp analyzer, divided by the number of extra keys moved from the previous layout (4-3-3-3-4-4-12 keys). As seen, effort gain per key increases the most for the first Tarmak steps. Switching to Tarmak 2–4 really gains you a lot of benefit for your troubles. The first step may seem ineffective in comparison, but it bears the penalty of having to displace the J key; if that step too had moved only 3 keys it'd have done better but it's still clear that the second step is very important too. After the last Tarmak step, the final 4-key change to Colemak doesn't produce much modeled benefit compared to the previous changes. Since the mini-loops of Tarmak have been sorted using this model that may be expected; however, I personally believe that the Colemak has significant important benefits that the model are blind to! The full Colemak has a lot less same-finger bigrams and gives other benefits compared to the last Tarmak step which the analyzer won't quite pick up.

The Workman layout moves 4 more keys but doesn't do significantly better in the model for that trouble (21.8% vs 21.3% for Colemak) even though it was designed in accordance with the Codesharp analysis model. The Dvorak "UI" layout plummets because it changes nearly twice as many keys as Colemak without doing better in the analysis at all. In the name of good sportsmanship, I show the "UI" variant of Dvorak which scored much better than the garden-variety Dvorak (21.4% vs 18.9%; the latter is comparable to Tarmak3).

Here's [url=http://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?pid=14545#p14545]a more recent analysis[/url] of both the old ETOIR and the current ETROI progressions. I did a side-by-side comparison on Patorjk's analyzer of a big chunk of text: A couple of chapters from Pride and Prejudice (found at Project Gutenberg) containing more than ten thousand strokes of the letter E should be representative for good English. The ETROI analysis is the basis for the heat map animation shown below.

The only 141 instances of J in this sample prove that it is indeed a rare letter – the rarest of those that are moved by Colemak. Even the colon/semicolon key and Z had more presses and only X and Q of all the letters less (241/142/102/83 presses, respectively). This is an argument for moving only the J around, as a letter that rare won't be used enough to settle in your motor memory before the next step.

Patorjk favorises hand alternation which brings Colemak to somewhat of a disadvantage [i]per se[/i] since Colemak focuses on same-hand rolls instead. I don't know whether this bias will play into the present analysis but I shouldn't think it matters a lot?

    The Colemak-DH a.k.a. "Curl(DH)" ergo mod is an ingenious way of getting the frequent D and H keys to better positions for people who dislike the "middle trench" positions (<i>QWERTY</i> GH) and feel that this part of the home row doesn't feel quite like home after all! See my main Big Bag topic or <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/user/2374-stevep99/"><b>stevep99</b></a>'s <a href="https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/">DH-mod pages on GitHub</a> for more info.
</p><p>
    Keep your hands at home position (<i>QWERTY</i> ASDF JKL;) and stretch inwards then down. Which is more comfortable?
</p>
<ul class="disc">
    <li>If you like the inwards stretches (<i>QWE</i> GH) best, ignore the curl mod. (Or, try again while keeping your wrists straight as they should ideally be!)</li>
    <li>If you like the downward curls (<i>QWE</i> CM) best, consider Colemak-DH!</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Curl(DH) mod requires an Angle mod (see above) to work well on standard row-staggered keyboards. Colemak-DH is good on matrix boards too, though.
</p><p>
    In Oct 2020, <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/user/2374-stevep99/"><b>stevep99</b></a>, myself and others agreed on promoting one common Colemak-DH:
</p>
<ul class="disc">
    <li>It's the original DH-mod alias Curl-DHm, which has...</li> 
    <li>G and M on the old home row, which works well both for standard row-staggered boards and matrix boards. <br>
        This version supersedes the 2017 DHk standard with K on the home row. That version wasn't so nice for matrix boards.</li>
</ul>

    Here are the Tarmak steps for Colemak-DH, shown on an ISO keyboard:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <b>Tarmak-CurlAngle-ISO:</b> <br>
        <b>1a)</b> The <b>E</b>&gt;K&gt;<b>N</b>&gt;(J) "most essential" loop, fixing the important E (and N)
    </p>
    <img class="smallImg left" src="res/cmk/tarmak/Tarmak-CA-ISO_Spectral-cpt/Tmk1_RBo_E.png" />    <i>Tarmak1(E) "vanilla"</i><br>
    <p>
        <b>1b)</b> The <b>H</b>&gt;M Curl(H) swap, by default combined with step 1a
    </p>
    <img class="smallImg left" src="res/cmk/tarmak/Tarmak-CA-ISO_Spectral-cpt/Tmk1-C_RBo_E.png" />    <i>Tarmak1(E)-Curl</i><br>
    <p>
        <b>2a)</b> The Angle (B&gt;C&gt;X&gt;Z&gt;_) mod, in preparation for Tarmak2-CurlAngle
    </p>
    <img class="smallImg left" src="res/cmk/tarmak/Tarmak-CA-ISO_Spectral-cpt/Tmk1-CA_RBo_E.png" />    <i>Tarmak1(E)-CurlAngle</i><br>
    <p>
        <b>2b)</b> The (J)&gt;B&gt;<b>T</b>&gt;F loop, bringing the important T into place – with the DH mod
    </p>
    <img class="smallImg left" src="res/cmk/tarmak/Tarmak-CA-ISO_Spectral-cpt/Tmk2-CA_RBo_T.png" />    <i>Tarmak2(ET)-CurlAngle</i><br>
    <p>
        <b>3)</b> The (J)&gt;<b>R</b>&gt;<b>S</b>&gt;<b>D</b> loop, getting RSD into place – all of which are relatively frequent!
    </p>
    <img class="smallImg left" src="res/cmk/tarmak/Tarmak-CA-ISO_Spectral-cpt/Tmk3-CA_RBo_R.png" />    <i>Tarmak3(ETR)-CurlAngle</i><br>
    <p>
        <b>4)</b> The J&gt;Y&gt;<b>O</b>&gt;;&gt;P loop, getting O in place and finalizing the big loop
    </p>
    <img class="smallImg left" src="res/cmk/tarmak/Tarmak-CA-ISO_Spectral-cpt/Tmk4-CA_RBo_O.png" />    <i>Tarmak4(ETRO)-CurlAngle</i><br>
    <p>
        <b>5)</b> The L&gt;U&gt;<b>I</b> self-contained loop - step 5 is simply the full Colemak-DH!
    </p>
    <img class="smallImg left" src="res/cmk/tarmak/Tarmak-CA-ISO_Spectral-cpt/Tmk5-CA_RBo_I.png" />    <i>Colemak-DH</i><br>

    I've split steps 1 and 2 above for clarity. But if you're the careful type you may choose to split them in practice too:
</p><p>
    The full Tarmak1-Curl(H) step is a 6-key one which may be a bit much if you're new to layout switches. If that is the case, consider taking on the normal Tarmak1 step first!. In fact, you could do the H-M swap whenever you like in the progression, but for my own sanity's sake I've put it in step 1.
</p><p>
    Similarly, if it seems that a lot is happening in the Tarmak2-Curl(DH) step then you may try tackling only the CurlAngle mod (_ZXCVB→XCB_V in this case) first. In this case, the B gets temporarily misplaced. Several implementations allow you to select the DH mod separately.

    Tarmak-DH on ANSI keyboards:
</p><p>
    For ANSI/US keyboards, you have to choose an ANSI-Angle mod as these boards don't have the extra key between Z and LShift. The most common one is Angle(Z), which moves Z into the middle where the B used to be as XC move to the left. The Curl mod then arranges B and D as usual:

    Tarmak-DH transitions are found in my Big Bag implementations – see the various platform boxes.

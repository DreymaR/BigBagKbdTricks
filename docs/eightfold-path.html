            <div><span style="font-weight: bold;">INTRODUCTION TO </span><span
                    style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">SATI</span></div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>What is Mindfulness? Many are justly sceptical to the word these days, as it has been hijacked and misused
                and its meaning is at best unclear by now. So, here's what it means to me and why I find it useful and
                recommend it.</div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>Mindfulness, or <span style="font-style: italic;">Sati</span> as it may be named in the East, is a concept
                of Zen philosophy that has become popular in the West both as self help and therapy. I started using it to
                minimize the risk of becoming heavily depressed again, and I think it really helped me with that. Research
                shows that it can be useful to psychology in many ways. I won't go into detail here, but the works of for
                instance&nbsp;Jon Kabat-Zinn and Richard J Davidson are readily available for study.</div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>So what is it then? To me, it's about training your mind to be present. Maybe you feel connected and aware
                when walking in the forest or your garden, or when exercising? True, such activities can be mindful. But
                what about when there is no calm sea nor&nbsp;greenery around, and you feel stress and other
                turbulent&nbsp;emotions? Just like we can train our bodies to be healthy and stronger, we can also train our
                minds to be present and able to handle more.</div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>I'm not very diligent about it, much like I don't get as much exercise as my body&nbsp;needs. But a little
                is a lot better than nothing! When I find a moment in my day, I may meditate a bit and it feels great
                afterwards. Like with physical exercise it will not always be entirely pleasant but as it becomes a habit
                you'll love it more and more.</div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>Pure mindfulness meditation is very simple and may therefore, paradoxically, be difficult to master: Just
                feel your breath to anchor yourself. Don't control anything by force. When your "monkey mind" wanders off –
                and&nbsp;it will! – lead it back to the here and now, gently and compassionately. Be your own friend, and be
                present. Register what you're thinking and feeling, don't force it or run away from it&nbsp;but guide
                yourself back to you, to the&nbsp;now.&nbsp;If something feels unpleasant, try just "sitting through" and
                observing it. Keep doing that. It's that simple, and that hard.</div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>You can practise mindfulness in many ways. Walking slowly while being fully aware is a good practice.
                Nature is generally a wonderful aid to grounding your mind. You can eat or drink – tea, for instance –
                mindfully, by doing just that and nothing else at the same time. You can sit mindfully for half an hour in a
                shrine, or for three minutes on the bus. You can play a music instrument mindfully – flutes are great since
                you use your breath to play. With experience, you can do most things in a mindful way.</div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>I often use a self-devised guided meditation as described below. It is still&nbsp;about being mindful, but
                with some focus points. In my opinion, this makes it more beginner-friendly but still very useful. I usually
                go through a route of eight points which I call my "compass", and this helps me see myself and be calmly
                present. Read on if you're interested!</div>

            <div><br></div>
            <div><span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp; &nbsp; ~ With quotes from Thích Nhất Hạnh</span></div>
            <div><span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;~ Compiled and written by Øystein Bech Gadmar alias
                    "DreymaR"</span></div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>I like to&nbsp;meditate focusing on eight areas of both body and psyche using mental images (similar to
                eidetic <span style="font-style: italic;">kasiṇa</span>), after initially anchoring on the breath itself.
                These images are inspired by the talks and writings of Zen master Thích Nhất Hạnh ('Thay') and his pupil
                Svein Myreng.</div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Noble Eightfold Path</span> of Buddhism is a great inspiration. It
                consists of 'right' ways&nbsp;('<span style="font-style: italic;">sammā'</span> in Pali) concerning</div>
            <div>• <span style="font-weight: bold;">Wisdom</span> (view/understanding, resolve/intention),</div>
            <div>• <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ethics</span> (speech, action/conduct, livelihood/way-of-life) and</div>
            <div>• <span style="font-weight: bold;">Concentration</span> (effort/diligence, mindfulness/attention,
                concentration/meditation).</div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>Thay says: "It's possible for us to live the Noble Eightfold Path every moment of our daily lives. That not
                only makes us happy, it makes people around us happy. If you practice the path, you become very pleasant,
                very fresh, and very compassionate."</div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>Below,&nbsp;I've combined this with the eight Chinese&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">I Ching</span>
                trigrams and their associated elements which I find a fascinating little&nbsp;exercise. This should not at
                all be overinterpreted, as for me it is merely a stimulus providing intensity and life to the mental imagery
                and should not lead to any rigidity or limitation!</div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>For each of the eight points I focus on the body area&nbsp;and my breath for as many breaths as I feel like
                and have time for. During the first couple of breaths,&nbsp;I recite two words summing up&nbsp;the
                mental&nbsp;imagery for myself.</div>

            <div>Solidity makes it possible for us to be happy. Someone who is unstable, someone who is not solid, cannot be
                a happy person. When you are solid, people can rely on you. When your loved one is solid, you can rely on
                her. So solidity is something that you can offer to the person you love, like freshness.</div>

            <div>Picture a tree in a storm. At the top of the tree, the small branches and leaves are swaying violently in
                the wind. The tree looks vulnerable, quite fragile – it seems it can break at any time. But if you look at
                the trunk, you will see that the tree is solid; and if you look down to its root structure, you will know
                that the tree is deeply and firmly rooted in the soil.</div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>Sitting quietly, just breathing in and out, we develop strength, concentration and clarity. So sit like a

            <div><span style="font-style: italic;">“Breathing in, I see myself as space, breathing out, I feel free. Space,

            <div><br></div>
            <div>Space is freedom, and freedom is the foundation of true happiness. Without freedom, our happiness is not
                complete. Freedom from what? Freedom from fear, from craving, from anger, from despair, from our projects
                and worries. Breathing in, you bring a lot of space into yourself. Breathing out, you bring a lot of space
                to your beloved ones.</div>
            <div><br></div>
            <div>Everyone needs some space inside and around us to be truly happy. If we love someone, we should know how to
                offer him enough space, inside and outside. If you don’t have enough space for yourself, how can you offer
                space to the person you love? Therefore it’s crucial that we know how to cultivate more space for ourselves.
                If you have freedom and you can offer freedom, you are a true lover. You don’t imprison yourself and you
                don’t imprison the person you love. You have freedom in your heart, and you offer freedom to her.</div>

            <div><br></div>
            <div>Suppose you tell your mom, “I have a gift for you.” Your mom may ask you, “Where is the gift? ” Then you
                point to yourself and say, “I am the gift!” You are fresh like a flower. You are solid like a mountain. You
                are calm, peaceful, like still water. You are free like space. That is what you want to offer to the person
                you love. If you do not have any freshness, solidity, peace, or freedom, you don’t have much to offer to the
                person you love.</div>

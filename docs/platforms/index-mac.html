    <p>Sadly, there isn't a lot of content for the Apple user here. Colemak Forum user <b>mkborregaard</b> implemented some of the <b><a href="https://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=2020">Big Bag (Mac) for Karabinier</a></b> <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/post/18673/#p18673"> (not maintained by me; who knows more about this?</a>), but this tool doesn't work well anymore.</p>

    <p>
        I hear good things about the <a href="https://github.com/david-janssen/kmonad">KMonad Keyboard Management Tool</a>, and it seems able to implement layers and Extend well across platforms. Maybe I'll get around to trying it out. For now, if anyone has good news about Apple platform implementations of the BigBag or similar tricks, please let me know.

        My xkb Tarmak files are all based on my standard Colemak[eD](US English) layout with no options for other lv3-4 mappings. They are learning aids anyway, so this shouldn't be much of a problem.

    <b class="italic">HowTo:</b>

    <ul class="disc">
        <li>Entering "Tarmak" in the search field in the layout chooser should show the four Tarmak layouts from E (the first) to ETRO (the last step before Colemak)
        <li>Using command line or default file, they're called: <br>
            <b>us(tarmak1__e)</b> – "English (Tarmak1 - Colemak[eD] transitional)" <br>
            <b>us(tarmak2__et)</b> – "English (Tarmak2 - Colemak[eD] transitional)" <br> 
            <b>us(tarmak3__etr)</b> – "English (Tarmak3 - Colemak[eD] transitional)" <br>
            <b>us(tarmak4__etro)</b> – "English (Tarmak4 - Colemak[eD] transitional)"</li>
        <li>Also, there are some special Tarmak steps for learning Colemak with CurlAngle mods: <br>
            <b>us(tarmak1c_e)</b> – "English (Tarmak1h - Colemak[eD] transitional w/ Curl-H mod)" <br>
            <b>us(tarmak2c_et)</b> – "English (Tarmak2dh - Colemak[eD] transitional w/ Curl-DH mod)"</li>
        <li>(For the old DHm mod, the first Tarmak step can be learnt without any modification, but you may learn the Angle mod first and should learn it by step 2.)</li>
        <li>Tarmak step 3–4 can be combined with Curl by activating a Curl mod through the misc options or editing the symbols file containing your layout.</li>

    <ul class="disc">
        <li>You can select any layout from the normal layout chooser – enter your language in the search field to narrow it down. There are two types:</li>
        <li>"Unified symbols" <b>(cmk_ed_us)</b> layouts, using the US-like symbol mappings that I recommend; these give the full Colemak[eD] experience</li>
        <li>"Keep local symbols" <b>(cmk_ed_ks)</b> layouts, if you don't want to change the symbol mappings from your locale but just the letter keys (and semicolon)</li>
        <li>Using command line or default file, the Cmk[eD] layouts are called 'lc:cmk_ed_us' and 'lc:cmk_ed_ks', where 'lc' is the locale code ('se' for Swedish for instance)</li>
    </ul>

        <li>You can select any layout from the normal layout chooser – enter your language in the search field to narrow it down.</li>
        <li>The non-latin script variants are called "<b>&lt;Language&gt; (Colemak, phonetic)</b>"</li>
        <li>Using command line or default file, the phonetic layouts are called 'ru:colemak', 'bg:colemak', 'gr:colemak' and 'il:colemak'</li>

        On XKB: Using a Group setup, add the mirrored Colemak[eD] as your next layout group. <br>
             Then you may choose between a slew of "key(s) to change layout (while pressed)" options! <br>
             This does compromise your group options a bit (if you need to use non-latin layouts etc). <br>
             If that bothers you, consider using both 'next' and 'last' layout groups with chooser keys. <br>
             Use Ubuntu: 'Keyboard Layout'->'Options'->'key(s) to change layout (while pressed)'.

        <li>This is only for English(US) – if you want something else you'll have to edit it in yourself.</li>
        <li>You can choose it in the normal language chooser; it's called "<b>English (Colemak[eD], mirrored)</b>"</li>
        <li>Using command line or default file, the layout is called '<b>us:cmk_ed_mirror</b>'</li>
        <li>AngleWide is chosen separately, as a keyboard model (see above)</li>

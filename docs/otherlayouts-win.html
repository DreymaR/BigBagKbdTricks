            <h2>THE TARMAK TRANSITIONAL COLEMAK LAYOUTS</h2>

            <p>There's a <a href="tarmak.html"><b>main Tarmak topic</b></a> that you should take a look at. Basically, I've added four Tarmak layouts that provide stepping stones from the standard QWERTY layout to Colemak[eD] by moving only 3-4 keys per step. Each step brings at least one important key to the home row (notably, E-T-R-O-I) and only the rare J key is misplaced in the process. If you're brave and impatient, you may of course skip steps to customize your progress.</p>

            <p>Tarmak transitional layouts have been <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=480">reported successful in easing the conversion to Colemak typing</a> and although this evidence is anecdotal I find the <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=358">proposed hypothesis</a> that gradual changes should be easier to learn for many a plausible one.</p>

            <p class="italic">The 5-step Tarmak (transitional Colemak) layouts, spectrally color-coded from red (Tarmak#1) to violet (Colemak).</p>

            <div class="platform-specific">
                <p>These transitional layouts were implemented as VirtualKey ones, so any AltGr and dead key mappings you'll get will be the same as on your installed keyboard layout in Windows. The layouts should support Extend mode fully. If you define several of them in your EPKL settings file, you can swiftly change between them should you wish to.</p>

                <p>My EPKL settings file comes with lines prepared for Tarmak progressions that you may simply uncomment (commenting out whatever else 'layout =' lines are active there) and start using. You may choose between a progression to vanilla Colemak or to Colemak-DH (see above). Wide mods are not (yet) available for Tarmak, but they may not be that necessary as you can always go Wide after you've reached the goal.</p>

                <p>There's a help image for each step, that you can see or hide with the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+1 (configurable in pkl.ini). Holding Shift will show the current and previous steps in different colors.</p>

            <h2>LOCALE COLEMAK[eD] VARIANTS</h2>
            <p>See <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=1458">my Locale Variants forum topic</a> for the various locale solutions.</p>

            <p>I took off a bit and made quite a bunch of these, heh! I can make more on request. It'd be nice with feedback from local users as some design decisions are open to debate and depend on actual usage as well as personal preferences.</p>

            <p>Here's what I've covered so far, for the most part both with conservative 'keep local symbols' and my preferred 'unified symbols' variants
                (On a side note, there were only 11 Dvorak layouts in the xkb files last time I looked!): <br>
                <b>al at ba be bg br ca cz de dk es fi fr gb gr hr hu il is it latam nl no pl pt ro rs ru se si tr us</b></p>

            <p>- The brackets (lvl3-4) and the LSGT key may hold the most common locale-specific keys.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The oe/aring special letters may well be replaced; these should also be on dead keys.</li>
                <li>Furthermore, keys with non-essential mappings (H J K L) are up for grabs if need be.</li>
                <li>See the colemak_template symbols file for more info on local Colemak[eD] variants.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="italic">The Colemak [edition DreymaR] layout, Norwegian+Danish 'Unified Symbols' variant (mostly like the standard Colemak above).</p>

            <p class="italic">The Colemak [edition DreymaR] layout, Norwegian 'Keep Local Symbols' variant (symbols like local key markings).</p>

            <p>Please note: The 'Local Symbols' variant for a locale uses symbol mappings from the default locale layout (usually a QWERTY one), which are also the ones normally found on physical key markings on keyboards made for that locale. The letter block, however, is the Colemak[eD] one which may lead to some inconsistencies or faults in lv3-4 mappings. For the most consistent and complete set of AltGr mappings, use the 'Unified Symbols' variants.</p>

            <div class="platform-specific">
                <p>To make your own locale variant you'll want to copy the layout folder for my eD layout over to a new one, renaming it (and putting that new name into your pkl.ini file so the program can choose it!) and then editing the layout.ini file in there.</p>

            <h2>PHONETIC COLEMAK LAYOUTS FOR NON-LATIN SCRIPTS</h2>
            <p>See the <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?pid=10016#p10016">phonetic subtopic of my Locale topic</a> for more info on these layouts.</p>

            <p>For the Greek and Hebrew phonetic variants I mostly moved the keys of their default phonetic xkb layouts to a Colemak setup, hardly changing anything else. Ideally, I should be able to define phonetic names for the keys corresponding to Colemak so that other 'phonetic' layouts would work automatically, but I think the XKB way of doing that may be too QWERTY-centric for that to work right now. For Kyrillic, I've used Ghen's excellent Rulemak which under my xkb patch is found under 'Russian (Colemak, phonetic E-Slavic)'. It isn't for Russians only, but that's how xkb likes to sort things. Similarly, for South Slavic there's the Bulgarian (Colemak, phonetic S-Slavic) variant now. Let me know how that works out, please?</p>

            <h2>MIRRORED COLEMAK</h2>
            <p>Advanced typing is possible with only one hand given a mimimum of training with the mirroring method. In fact, this paragraph was written entirely using the left hand with the exception of the mirroring key itself, with hardly any training! The brain is inherently good at mirroring things.</p>

            <p>I think the Colemak is a very good layout for this kind of one-handed typing: It scores well on home-row usage, finger load balance and same-finger bigram avoidance, and it doesn't focus overmuch on hand alternation which could lead to same-finger bigrams when mirror-typing (Dvorak has lots of hand alternation; it also has separate right-hand and left-hand variants but then you'd have to learn a new layout).</p>

            <p>You'll want an easily accessible key (such as a thumb key) to switch between normal and mirrored typing. One suggestion is using LAlt for left-handed typing, and RAlt or RWin for right-handed typing. But you may instead use an arm or foot switch set to any other key (maybe an out-of-the-way one like ScrollLock), or a "ghetto switch" made by stripping most keys off a keyboard and placing it on the floor. A more fancy but still cheap switch could be made by soldering the wires from a foot pedal switch (if you have something useable) to the contacts of a key on a cheap keyboard.</p>

            <p>Some adventurous souls might want to try the mirrored Colemak as a main layout? Some say it's more similar to Dvorak that way. However, my implementation is meant for one-handed typing. To use it as a standalone layout, you'll want to take out the remapping of special keys.</p>

            <p class="italic">The Mirrored Colemak layout, which should be good for right-handed typing (the Angle mod is recommended for this)</p>

            <p class="italic">The Mirrored Colemak layout with the AngleWide-Slash mod (see the Wide mod heading); better for left-handed typing I think</p>

            <div class="platform-specific">
                <p>EPKL supports multiple Extend layers. This could be used to get Mirrored Colemak by replacing the Extend mappings, usually the first layer (Ext1). You can't have both at the same time without using additional modifiers unfortunately. And that's too bad since the Mirrored plus Extend combo would be a damn handy thing for one-handed typers!</p>

                <p>If you look into the _eD_Extend.ini file you'll find a Mirror section at the very end. It's still a work-in-progress though; let me know if you want to use it and need help! It may be a better idea to make a mirrored layout and make a modifier for it though, but I'll have to look into that option.</p>

                <h2>DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL</h2>

                <p>Files for Portable Keyboard Layout (PKL) by Farkas Máté can be found here:<br><a href="https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixPKL" target="_"><b>My PKL repo at GitHub, with all layouts and stuff</b></a></p>

                <p>This topic is already too long and complex so I can't add a lot of support for PKL here, but basically:</p>

                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>PKL runs on Windows (XP, 7/8/10 – except some "secure" dialogs)</li>
                    <li>It's portable: Just run it from anywhere! You don't need Install rights, and it doesn't change the Registry nor anything outside its own folders</li>
                    <li>You can carry it with you on a USB drive and run it directly from the USB drive, as long as you have Run privileges from that drive; or put it in the Cloud!</li>
                    <li>It's compatible with the wonderful <a href="http://portableapps.com/" target="_"><b>PortableApps</b></a> format</li>
                    <li>To run PKL with the PortableApps menu, put the PKL folder in the PortableApps folder (e.g., C:\PortableApps) – that's all!</li>
                    <li>To run PKL at startup, put a shortcut to pkl.exe (e.g., Alt-drag the program icon somewhere) in your Windows Startup folder</li>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– To access the Startup folder, press Win+R (for the Run dialog) then enter 'shell:startup'
                    <li>The above will work by user, so you can use your PKL independently of others (but all users of one PKL will share the same settings)</li>
                    <li>PKL won't be running at first logon but will remain active under a screen lock, so I recommend getting a layout-independent password or learning your password on all layouts you're using!</li>

                    <li>The main settings file is PKL_Settings.ini, in which you can choose a layout. Layout specific settings are in that layout's folder in a layout.ini file.</li>
                    <li>In PKL_Settings.ini I have a shortcut system for my layouts: You can specify board type (ANSI/ISO), AngleWide and Curl mods, and locale code.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– If that layout combination exists, it'll be used. Check the Layouts folder to see your options.</li>   
                    <li>The file formats (pkl.ini and layout.ini files) are understandable and commented, but not always simple. Proper documentation, unfortunately, doesn't exist yet.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>PKL TIPS AND TRICKS</h2>
                <li>You can adjust the size of the help images in the layout.ini file; I've included a few options but anything goes really<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– My help images have a native resolution of 96 dpi which makes them 812×282 pixels<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– If you want smaller images you could use for instance 2/3 or 1/2 of that in both directions<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– There is a scale setting in % for each layout, and also a global Zoom hotkey setting to switch between sizes</li>
                <li>If you want to use the CapsLock key for something else or use another key for your Extend modifier:<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– Change the value of the 'extend_key =' line in layout.ini<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– You'll have to use the "enumerated" names for keys, such as 'BACK' for Backspace...<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– ...or a scan code such as 'sc00e'.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– Check the file for more names and info.</li>
                <li>To disable the Extend key, set its value to 'disabled'.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– This should work for any other key you wish to remove too.</li>
                <li>If, say, you want a Colemak-style Backspace key on your CapsLock, change its mapping:<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– Change the value of the active 'CapsLock =' line in layout.ini to 'BACK    VirtualKey'.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– Remove the rest of the line or add a tab and semicolon after the value above.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– If you want PKL to ignore a key instead, just put a semicolon before or delete that line.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– If so, make sure you also turn off CapsLock as Extend as described above.</li>

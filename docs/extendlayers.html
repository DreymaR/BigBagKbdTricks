            Living without Extend at this point would seem like some kind of perverse hell imposed as punishment for terrible crimes committed in numerous past lives.</p>
        </div>

        <p>As described in <b>my <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2315-dreymars-big-bag-of-keyboard-tricks-main-topic/">Big Bag</a> topics (for <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=1438">Linux/XKB</a>, <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=1467">Windows/PKL</a> and <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=2158">USB-2-USB/TMK devices</a>)</b>, the Extend mappings are wonderful and in my opinion at least as useful as Colemak itself. Also, they're much <b>easier to start using</b> as you don't have to learn much to get started and can <b>grow gradually into full mastery</b> without any loss of efficiency – even ingrained QWERTY die-hards could get used to a little Extend on the side unless they're completely backwards. You start up using the <b>arrow keys in the home position</b> and/or <b>multimedia keys</b>, and before you know it you'll be jumping around <b>selecting whole words</b> at a time and doing more and more advanced stuff.</p>

        <p>Another advantage of using Extend is that all these <b>shortcut tricks are available on other computers</b> too, albeit in more awkward geometries as you have to reach for arrow and PgUp/Dn etc keys without the power of Extend. Extend may not be as powerful as specialized navigation software like Vimperator/Pentadactyl or MouselessBrowsing, but it's <b>generic, usable in all apps/modes and always ready</b>, and for me at least it comes with my layout which I have to install anyway so it's "already there" without having to manage any extra software. I actually think that even the mighty Vim benefits from it (as its keys are OmniMode and no remappings are needed)!</p>

        <p>I've been dabbling, learning and experimenting since 2008 to become an Adept of Extending, if I may call myself that. So I'd like to share some tricks here, to make everyone see how much better your computing experience can become with this mouse relieving wonder – along with some other shortcuts I've picked up along the way.</p>

        <p>Many of the tricks described here work under <b>both Windows and Linux</b>, as they often use the same shortcuts. Some are Windows specific though, and some are specific for some browsers (I mostly use Firefox but there are usually plugins and/or similar tricks available for other browsers). Macs often have different tacks and I haven't used one of those in a while so I can't really enlighten you much there – but the principles are the same so I guess Mac users could learn to love the Extend mode as much as I do. Up until recently there weren't any <b><a href="https://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=2020">Extend mappings for Macs</a></b>, but fortunately user mkborregaard has remedied that. Yay!</p>

        <h2> ... What?</h2>

        <p>Oh, sorry. Maybe you don't know or remember exactly what Extend is? If you do, you may skip to the next part now. For those reading on, Extend is like the Fn layer that some laptops have to get the NumPad and maybe some other keys. Some compact "hacker" keyboards such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Hacking_Keyboard">Happy Hacking Keyboard</a> also sport Fn layers that give easy access to arrows, F# keys and other keys that are missing from the reduced-size keyboard.</p>

        <img src="content/images/HHKBPro2_EliteKbds.png" alt="HHKBPro2_EliteKbds.png">
        <p class="italic">The legacy of Extend: The Happy Hacking Keyboard's Fn layer for navigation, media and F# keys.</p>

        <p>Instead of an extra hardware key, the Extend mappings can use any key really as that extra "Fn"/Shift-type modifier, but usually it's <b>CapsLock</b> that gets the honor. I wanted a better layout than the one above, so I and others on the Colemak forums came up with one around 2008. It was later expanded and implemented in PortableKeyboardLayout (PKL) by its creator Farkas Máté who also to my knowledge came up with the name 'Extend' for this wonder. Interestingly, the same nav key setup is seen on the fancy <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/">Ultimate Hacking Keyboard</a>! I have no idea who came up with it first, but they have almost the right idea there. (Almost?!? Yes, unfortunately they put the dorky Insert key in a too good position, left lots of good keys open and didn't make accessible Alt/Shift/Ctrl keys – we'll get back to those in a minute.)</p>

        <p>My Extend layout is similar to the default PKL one, but I've worked more on it adding mousing and multimedia and fiddling with some key placements. This, then, is the result:</p>

        <p class="italic">My Extend mappings for XKB/Linux; the Windows/PKL ones are nearly identical save for the VK_102 and Slash keys.</p>

        World/ISO board. Windows/PKL mappings with MouseWheel R/L keys. [1st image above: US/ANSI board with Linux mappings.]</p>

        <p>Note the <b>home position modifier keys</b>: These make it easy to hit powerful shortcut combinations! Alt+F4 is now accessible from the home position as Ext-A+4. Select Previous Word (Ctrl+Shift+Left) becomes Ext-S+T+N, etc etc. Letter shortcuts like Ctrl+Q don't work but some have alternatives like Alt+F4 that do. Also, there's no Win (GUI) key because it proved hard to implement and many Win-key shortcuts use letters. But the point of Extend isn't to replace those shortcuts – it's to bring the arrows and other out-of-the-way keys close to your home position to make you faster and stronger!</p>

        <p>Some useful shortcuts like Ctrl+A (Select All), Ctrl+S (Save), Ctrl+W (Close – Ctrl+F4 unfortunately doesn't work everywhere) and Ctrl+(Shift+)T (Re-/Open Tab) are quite easy to reach with one hand, even though it means twisting your wrist to reach the Ctrl key. Unless you use them a lot, they don't need to be on Extend mappings. If you feel that you need any of these in Extend mode, you could always use the Tilde key and/or one of the Escapes (or a right hand key like Ins, Menu, Favorites, Break, Mouse buttons, the Slash key – anything you feel you don't need of course).</p>

        <p>The Extend mappings are mostly positional so they'll <b>work with any layout</b> – even if some keys like A and ZXCVB might be easier to remember using Colemak or QWERTY. If you use Angle and/or Wide ergo mods the Extend mappings should move accordingly to match the transposed home positions of the ZXVCB and right-hand keys. Other than that, I wouldn't move around the Extend mappings to suit different underlying layouts as they mostly go by key position.</p>

        <p>On an interesting side note, the <b><a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/">Ultimate Hacking Keyboard (UHK)</a></b> has a "Mod" layer that seems to have borrowed quite a few mappings from my page, including the nav block that I designed in 2007/2008. Can it be coincidential? They have almost the right idea but it's still not nearly as good as a proper Extend: They missed the oh so important home row modifiers – we'll get back to those in a minute! – put the fairly useless Insert key where the very useful Back key should've been and left lots of good positions open. Nice try but no Extend. ^_^</p>

        <p>Here's the Mod layer of the UHK so you can see what I mean:</p>

        <h2> ... How?</h2>

        <p>Head over to the appropriate <b>Big Bag topic (<a href="https://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=1438">Linux/XKB</a>, <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=1467">Windows/PKL</a>, <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2158-dreymars-big-bag-of-keyboard-tricks-usb2usb-edition/">USB-2-USB</a></b> or <b>mkborregaard's <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=2020">Mac topic</a>)</b> for resources and instructions on how to use this. In the standard setup, the CapsLock key becomes a "switch" modifier like the Shift key, that you hold down for the Extend mappings. One might also have "latch" (press and release modifier, then press key) or "lock" (like CapsLock) modifiers; for the main Extend layer I don't think that'll be so useful though. Using Linux, if you set two modifiers with the 'level5_switch_lock' behaviour, they'll actually work as a switch alone but a lock if pressed together! The Mac implementation has a separate ExtendLock key.</p>

        <p>Much of Extend's power is immediately obvious. Shortcuts you've been using easily and intuitively translate to their Extend counterparts. One of the advantages of Extend, as mentioned, is the transparent correspondence between Extend and non-Extend shortcuts. But there are very useful tricks that even I didn't know until quite recently. Having the necessary keys more available creates new possibilities for awesomeness, and so using Extend over time will be a pleasantly surprising journey if you're anything like me.</p>

        <p>Below I'll go through some shortcut categories and explain how Extend can help you excel in them. <b><em>Prestidigitatus</em></b> – let the magic begin! ;-)</p>

        <h3 class="underlined">MULTIMEDIA KEYS</h3>

        <p>All the keys marked in orange on the Extend images above are multimedia keyboard keys. They work pretty much as expected, though in most Linux distros you may have to assign some of them manually. There are different keys on Ext-Shift since you don't usually shift multimedia keys – but in Windows/PKL those unfortunately cannot be implemented (yet).</p>

        <p>I looked to Apple keyboards and various others, but settled on my own layout which seems very logical to me:<br>• <b>F1–F4: Play/Pause, Previous, Next, Stop</b>.<br>• <b>F5–F8: Mute, Volume-, Volume+, Media Player</b>.<br>• <b>F9–F12: Browser Home, Search, App1 (File Manager†), App2 (Calculator†) </b>.<br>• <b>F/P: Back/Forward</b> (like the browser/explorer buttons).<br>• <b>Apostrophe: Favorites</b>.<br>• <b>ZXCV: Undo/Cut/Copy/Paste</b> (there are special "GUI" versions triggered by multimedia keys, but they don't always work so I used Ctrl+ZXCV).<br>†: These are the default settings; you can configure what apps are defined as App1 and App2. (Using Windows, it takes registry editing.)</p>

        <p>Using Linux/XKB (or in the Extend2 layer; not yet implemented for Windows/PKL...):<br>• <b>Shift+F1–F4: Pause, Back, Forward, Eject</b>.<br>• <b>Shift+F5–F8: Reload </b>(though plain F5 does the same?)<b>, Brightness-, Brightness+, Sleep</b> (doesn't always work).<br>• <b>Shift+F9–F12: Browser, Mail, App3 </b>(if defined)<b>, App4 </b>(if defined).<br>• <b>Shift+Apostrophe: My Computer</b> (whatever that's for?).</p>

        <p>The App keys are worth mentioning: Besides volume controls, the <b>File Manager</b> and <b>Calculator</b> keys are the F# key ones I use the most. I could've hit Win and typed 'calc' too of course, but Ext-F12 is faster.</p>

+-------------------+----------------+---------------------------------+
        </code></pre>

        <p><b>Undo/Cut/Copy/Paste</b> are fairly obvious. They need to be on the Extend layer to avoid interruption and wrist gymnastics while editing. I tried using the multimedia key "GUI" versions of them, but those are sometimes poorly implemented so now it's the actual Ctrl+letter mappings as they seem to always work well.</p>

        <p><b>Mousing</b> with keys isn't all that powerful unless you spend more keys on it and get fancy. This is mostly for getting the pointer out of reading's way and sometimes the button is nice for regainining window focus. The right mouse button, as usual, brings up a context menu but I usually use the Menu[Ext-'] key for that as it shows the menu where it's relevant instead of at the mouse pointer position. The mouse wheel keys are very useful, as they scroll windows and with Ctrl zoom in/out using the left hand only. Pretty much a must for quality browsing.</p>

        <p>Another clear winner that I use all the time. There are good browser navigation programs and some will certainly prefer to go all the way and use Vimperator/Pentadactyl or similar, but to me Extend browsing feels very nice now. I just got used to the Firefox QuickFind feature which made the experience pretty much complete.</p>

        <p>This does depend somewhat on which browser you're using. Opera has good keyboard browsing built-in I hear, while Internet Explorer cannot do some things. I mostly use Firefox. Chrome does much of the same, but the QuickFind feature of Firefox is what makes me able to browse around without extra software/plugins. Fortunately there are QuickFind plugins for most browsers if you're interested. <br><br></p>

        <ul class="disc">
            <li><b>Back/Forward[Ext-F/P]</b> are very obviously useful "multimedia/browser" keys! They work for more than web pages, by the way.
            <li><b>MouseWheel Scroll Up/Down[Ext-W/R]</b> is something I use all the time. Often Up/Down[Ext-U/E] do the same, but not always. With Ctrl, these keys Zoom In/Out.
            <li><b>Ctrl+PageUp/Down[Ext-T+J/H]: Next/Previous Tab</b> is ever so useful. With Shift, you move the tab to a new position instead.
            <li><b>F5[Ext-5]: Refresh page</b> is often useful. With Ctrl or Shift, it ignores cached content which is necessary if you keep getting an old version of a page.
            <li><b>F6[Ext-6]: Go to Address bar (or back)</b>. Instead of opening a new tab with Ctrl+T I'll usually hit this and enter an URL or '?' and a search term. Then...
            <li><b>Alt+Enter[Ext-A+Spc]</b>: Open address in new tab.
            <li><b>F7[Ext-7] {In Firefox?}: Caret Browsing</b> is somewhat useful for selecting/copying text from pages, but not so much for navigating them. For that, QuickFind is superior. Unfortunately there's no easy way of seeing whether it's active so I keep the warning dialogue to tell when I'm entering Caret mode.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>/ or ' {In Firefox or using browser plugin}: QuickFind</b>. This is simply <b><em>delightful!</em></b></p>

        <ul>
            <li>Hitting the <b>Slash</b> key alone lets you find text on a page very quickly. It pretty much obviates the need for the more cumbersome Ctrl+F.</li>
            <li>But the true power lies in <b>Apostrophe: Search link text only</b>. Now you don't need the mouse to select links anymore! Just find some text that's fairly unique for any given link (including most page buttons!), hit <li>ostrophe and part of the text, and you're on your way.</li>
            <li>If you get multiple hits, type in more of the text or, failing that, navigate the hits with <b>(Shift+)F3[Ext-(S+)3].</b></li>
            <li><b>(Ctrl+)(Shift+)Enter[Ext-(T+)(S+)Spc]</b> opens the link. With Ctrl, it opens in a new tab and Ctrl+Shift moves the focus there. (Use Shift only for a new window.)</li>
            <li>If you wish, <b>Shift+F10[Ext-S+0]</b> opens up a link Context Menu for anything from opening to bookmarking and beyond.</li>

        <p>This is implemented in my Big Bag solutions for Windows(PKL), USB-2-USB(TMK) and Linux(XKB). In the former two you can configure a modifier or two that will modify which Extend layer gets activated by the Extend key; holding down the Extend key alone will maintain that layer.</p>

        <p>With Linux/XKB it's still a bit hard to access Ext2 as it requires Caps+AltGr (Right Alt) to be held down. There's even a "secret" layer for xkb using Caps+Shift+AltGr (it has some more arrow symbols and stuff), but that's ridiculous so I'll have to construct a better modifier! At the moment, I believe that for instance Alt+Caps (then hold down either Alt or Caps – not necessarily both) and similarly with AltGr and even Alt+AltGr, would be ideal.</p>

        <p>On Windows/PKL, all four layers are available using combinations of the two specified modifiers (by default RAlt and RShift) with Extend. The Ext3/Ext4 layers are set to be one-shot string layers, so if you press RShift+RAlt+Ext, then hold down Ext and press a home row letter you'll release a "powerstring" then fall back to Ext1 for normal editing.</p>

        <p>Other ideas for Extend layers might include more boilerplate text for coding, a better mousing layer etc.</p>

        <div class="quote"><p><b>Princess Irulan ("Dune") said:</b><br>
        "In this time, the most precious substance in the Universe is the spice Melange. The spice <em>extends</em> life. The spice expands consciousness. The spice is vital to space travel. The Spacing Guild and its navigators, who the spice has mutated over four thousand years, use the orange spice gas which gives them the ability to fold space. That is, travel to any part of the Universe without moving."</p></div>

        <p>It would seem that Frank Herbert is referring to Extend in this passage?! Fortunately, it took us substantially less than four thousand years and no messing with consciousness-expanding substances as we solved it in software! ;-)</p>

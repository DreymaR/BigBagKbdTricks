<h3>DREYMAR'S BIG BAG of KEYBOARD TRICKS – THE NEW PAGES</h3>
<p>
    Welcome to the new BigBag pages! The old ones are still found in the <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2315-dreymars-big-bag-of-keyboard-tricks-main-topic/"><b>BigBag topic at the Colemak Forum</b></a> as before. Our diligent Doozers are in the process of moving the important bits of it here, but if you're missing anything it may still be found by a stroll around the Forum Colemakum.  ( のvの) c[_]

    Since I started using the <a href="https://colemak.com/">Colemak keyboard layout</a> in early 2007 I've been fiddling with it, trying out ideas from the <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/">Colemak forum</a> and adding some of my own. Colemak <i>per se</i> is to me only the letter block mappings. I've always ended up with that mostly intact and it has stood the test of time: Even though the Colemak-DH mod has a lot of traction these days, it's still just a minor adjustment to vanilla Colemak and I consider them the same basic layout at heart. If you look at the ergonomic mods described here you'll see that I'm somewhat flexible about geometry – but in reality that's about the physical keyboard design and a better hand position. The layout itself stays essentially the same.<br><br>
    And so, <i>voila</i>, here it is! Have a look inside the Big Bag and see what you'll find!
</p>

<h3>HOWS:</h3>

<p>
    I use my own edition of Farkas Máté's excellent Portable Keyboard Layout – EPKL – to implement the Big Bag for Windows. For Linux, I've hacked up a bunch of modifications to the X.Org XKB files. Then I got me a USB-2-USB "QUICKIE" converter and implemented much of my tricks for that too; they should work for most programmable controllers. I'm pretty proud of it all, I must say! :)
</p>

<p>
    An advantage with my implementation is that in most cases you can pick and choose most of the enhancements as modules:<br>
<ul class="disc">
    <li>The Angle/Wide ergo mods are models/remaps so they work with any layout you choose (including QWERTY or Dvorak ones) and may be chosen per user</li>
    <li>The Extend layers and their switch key are options that should work with nearly any existing layout</li>
    <li>The locale/phonetic, Mirrored and Tarmak layouts are separate layout variants</li>
</ul>
<br>
    Freedom of choice through modularity is an ideal in the DreymaR world, as it is in Linux.

<h3>DONE:</h3>

<ul class="disc">
    <li>Get the Big Bag implementations (Win/EPKL, Linux/XKB, Controllers/TMK) up and going as GitHub repositories.</li>
    <li>Present the Big Bag more hypertextually on GitHub web pages with a colemak.org address (still Work-In-Progress).</li>
    <li>Updated Rulemak and Bulmak to 2016 versions (<b>ru/by/ua, bg/rs/mk</b> – although only found in <b>ru</b> and <b>bg</b> so far): <br>
        East Slavic (Russian/Church/Belarus/Ukraina?) & South Slavic (Bulgarian/ISO-9/Serbia(Cyrillic)/Macedonia?)</li>
    <li>Tarmak layouts for Curl-DH modders. The changes are minor, but should be easily accessible for the newcomer.</li>
    <li>Training topic: Alternative fingering. Tricks like sliding in for the NK/KN bigram are useful for the somewhat advanced typist.</li>
    <li>Transition from DHk (the 2017 standard) to DHm (SteveP's original DH mod) as the Colemak-DH standard</li>
</ul>


<h3>
    TODO:
</h3>

<ul class="disc">
    <li>Dead keys with currency on AltGr+4, Greek on AltGr+5, tech/math stuff on AltGr+= and IPA++ on AltGr+Shift+numbers(?) [done in EPKL]</li>
    <li>A total of 4 Extend layers: Basic/nav/edit, NumPad++, Coding/etc, Hotstrings – or whatever you like! [done in EPKL]</li>
    <li>Modifier keys for 4 Extend layers. For instance, Caps+{--, RShift, RAlt, RShift+RAlt}. Holding down Caps maintains the layer state.</li>
    <li>"Tap dance sequences", using dead keys and/or combines to release strings and things without having to hold modifier chords.</li>
    <li>Fix the Hebrew phonetic ("Hebmak") layout, once we agree on how! (With <b>wrapman</b> and whoever's interested.). Also an Arabic phonetic layout.</li>
    <li>Develop and test a <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2389-vietnamese-colemak/">Vietnamese Colemak</a> (with <b>icedryst</b> and whoever's interested).</li>
    <li>More locale variants: <b>epo</b> (Esperanto), …? (Any suggestions, or comments on the existing ones?)</li>
</ul>

<h3>LASTLY:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Best of luck with Colemak and its many marvelous mods! ^_^</li>
    <li>If you do get stuck, here's a little <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2157-joking-around/"><b>light entertainment</b></a> to hopefully Shift your mo(o)d. ;-)</li>

    Colemak's connected to the ... Curl* mod,<br>
    The Curl mod's connected to the ... Angle mod,<br>
    The Wide mod's connected to the ... shoulder bones,<br>
    And Extend's just wonderful!<br>

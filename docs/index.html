<h3>DREYMAR'S BIG BAG of KEYBOARD TRICKS – THE NEW PAGES</h3>
<p>
    Welcome to the new BigBag pages! The old ones are still found in the <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2315-dreymars-big-bag-of-keyboard-tricks-main-topic/"><b>BigBag topic at the Colemak Forum</b></a> as before. Our diligent doozers are in the process of moving the important bits of it here, but if you're missing anything it may still be found by a stroll around the Forum Colemakum.
</p>

<br><h3>INTRO</h3>
<p>
    My mission is to make your keyboard a lot more comfortable and powerful, even if you don't have an expensive programmable board. To this end, I use the Colemak layout with several ergonomic mods and additions that I and others have created over the years, on different OS platforms. These "tricks" are what this Big Bag is about.
</p><p>
    If you're new to this, there may be a lot of unfamiliar terms and concepts! You may not be sure whether your board or OS layout is <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/ANSI_vs_ISO">ISO or ANSI</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/dustypomerleau/29f5311089767cfbe5915c5743035710">row-staggered or ortho</a> – or something else. And what on earth are dead keys, ergo mods or Extend layers?! Relax and take a deep breath please, because it's all here. I hope you find what you're looking for and then a lot more useful stuff!
</p><p>
    If something is too obscure or hard, look up the community on the Colemak Forum and Discord. We're a right helpful lot! The BigBag is my go-to reply to many questions on the Discord and elsewhere, to the extent that a meme was created in my honor. Be warned...!

    <b><a href="https://colemak.com/">Colemak</a></b> is a wonderful keyboard layout that I and many others use daily with great enthusiasm. It may – and in all likelihood, it will! – make you a faster typist, although you can get very fast with other layouts too. More importantly, it makes typing a lot more comfortable and optimal, and your fingers will thank you for the rest of your life for choosing it!  ♪～╰(＊°▽°＊)╯～♪
</p><p>
    Since I started using using Colemak in early 2007 I've been fiddling with it, trying out ideas from the <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/">Colemak forum</a> and adding some of my own. Colemak <i>per se</i> is to me only the letter block mappings. I've always ended up with that mostly intact and it has stood the test of time: Even though the Colemak-DH mod has a lot of traction these days, it's still just a minor adjustment to vanilla Colemak and I consider them the same basic layout at heart. If you look at the ergonomic mods described here you'll see that I'm somewhat flexible about geometry – but in reality that's about the physical keyboard design and a better hand position. The layout itself stays essentially the same.
</p><p>
    And so, <i>voila</i>, here it is! Have a look inside the Big Bag and see what you'll find!  ( のvの) c[_]

<br><h3>DREYMAR'S BIG(!) BAG OF TRICKS?!? HALP, I'M NEW HERE!</h2>
<p>
    Inside this Big Bag there's a <i>lot</i> you can do in addition to learning Colemak! Some of it doesn't even require Colemak. So, this is a little beginner's introduction to the wonders of layout modding: What are your main options, and what's good to begin with?
</p><p>
    If any of this interests you right away, click the menus or submenus to continue exploring the Big Bag!
</p>
<ul class="dashed">
    <li><b>Tarmak:</b> This is a set of learning layouts for learning Colemak in 2–5 smaller steps.
        <ul class="disc">
            <li>Tarmak allows a much smoother and less taxing transition from QWERTY, although it will take longer.</li>
            <li>While you will lose speed at each new step, you'll regain it more quickly because the step is small.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Extend:</b> This mod is every bit as brilliant as Colemak itself, and independent of your typing layout! It lets you navigate, edit and more without moving your hands.
        <ul class="disc">
            <li>You could learn to Extend before you learn Colemak, during, or after; all platform implementations let you do that.</li>
            <li>Please realize that while Extend is technically "just" a layer with a modifier, it's a <i>lot</i> more powerful than your typical Fn key layer!
            <li>One of its greatest strengths is the possibilities arising from chording home row modifiers with navigation/editing and other keys.
            <li>If you want even more power, on some platforms you can add Extend-tapping for nearly endless possibilities.
            <li>See the <b><a href="extend-layers.html">Extend Extra Extreme</a></b> page if you need convincing.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Angle/Wide ergo mods:</b> These are also basically layout independent. QWERTY-AngleWide is definitely possible.
        <ul class="disc">
            <li>The <b>Angle</b> mod is simple, especially on an ISO keyboard: Slide ZXCVB one step to the left, keep your fingering but straighten your left wrist. Comfy!</li>
            <li>If you have an US/ANSI keyboard, you must make a tradeoff: Moving the Z key back to the old B position ("Angle-Z") is the most common solution.</li>
            <li>The <b>Wide</b> mod is quite simple on any keyboard: Slide the right-hand keys one step to the right, improving hand distance and thumb/pinky reaches. Neat!</li>
            <li>These are "hard" mods, you could even change the physical key caps to Angle/Wide positions if possible. My wife typed QWERTY-AngleWide without trouble.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>The Colemak-DH alias Curl(DH) ergo mod:</b> A Colemak-specific mod. Moving the common D and H down makes them easier to reach with lightly curled, relaxed fingers!
        <ul class="disc">
            <li>Some dislike the lateral index finger stretches to the "middle trench" so much, they made new but inferior(!) layouts to change this.</li>
            <li>As an example, the very common <b>HE</b> bigram requires such an inward stretch followed by a rapid repositioning.
            <li>Colemak-DH achieves the same as these layouts without losing any of Colemak's excellent performance stats.</li>
            <li>There is a tweaked <b><a href="tarmak.html#tmk-dh">Tarmak progression for Colemak-DH</a> if you want to learn it stepwise.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Colemak[eD]:</b> This only affects you if you'll be using the AltGr key, as it's about the extra mapping layers on each key.
        <ul class="disc">
            <li>Vanilla Colemak has several AltGr mappings, but they seem somewhat unintuitive and not really practical to me.</li>
            <li>My "<b><a href="https://dreymar.colemak.org/colemaked.html">[edition DreymaR]</a></b>" mappings place useful symbols and letters quite intuitively.</li>
            <li>Further symbols/letters are on <b><a href="https://dreymar.colemak.org/key-mappings.html#deadkeys">dead keys</a></b> that all reside on symbol keys with AltGr. In EPKL(Win) at least, there's a huge(!) bunch of glyphs/symbols!</li>
            <li>If you use any of my Big Bag files you'll mostly get Colemak[eD] AltGr mappings, or VK mappings without any shift states added.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Locale/script layouts:</b> If you use other languages than US English, you may want certain special letters, accents and symbols readily available.
        <ul class="disc">
            <li>I've devised lots of <b><a href="https://dreymar.colemak.org/other-layouts.html#locales">Locale Colemak</a></b> variants.</li>
            <li>Also, there are several variants for non-Latin scripts like Greek and Kyrillic letters. These are for the most part phonetically mapped to Colemak.
            <li>The different platforms don't all have the same selection available. You could try asking (nicely) if you're missing a variant.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>


<br><h3>HOWS</h3>

    Throughout the pages, select one of the four platform icons to see implementation-specific info in these boxes.

<div class="platform-box">
    <p>
        I use my own edition of Farkas Máté's excellent Portable Keyboard Layout – EPKL – to implement the Big Bag for Windows. For Linux, I've hacked up a bunch of modifications to the X.Org XKB files. Then I got me a USB-2-USB "QUICKIE" converter and implemented much of my tricks for that too; they should work for most programmable controllers. I'm pretty proud of it all, I must say! :)
    </p><p>
        An advantage with my implementation is that in most cases you can pick and choose most of the enhancements as modules:<br>
    <ul class="disc">
        <li>The Angle/Wide ergo mods are models/remaps so they work with any layout you choose (including QWERTY or Dvorak ones) and may be chosen per user</li>
        <li>The Extend layers and their switch key are options that should work with nearly any existing layout</li>
        <li>The locale/phonetic, Mirrored and Tarmak layouts are separate layout variants</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
        Freedom of choice through modularity is an ideal in the DreymaR world, as it is in Linux.

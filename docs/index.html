<h3>DREYMAR'S BIG BAG of KEYBOARD TRICKS – THE NEW PAGES</h3>
<p>
    Welcome to the new BigBag pages! The old ones are still found in the <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2315-dreymars-big-bag-of-keyboard-tricks-main-topic/"><b>BigBag topic at the Colemak Forum</b></a> as before. Our diligent doozers are in the process of moving the important bits of it here, but if you're missing anything it may still be found by a stroll around the Forum Colemakum.
</p>

<h3>INTRO</h3>
<p>
    My mission is to make your keyboard a lot more comfortable and powerful, even if you don't have an expensive programmable board. To this end, I use the Colemak layout with several ergonomic mods and additions that I and others have created over the years, on different OS platforms. These "tricks" are what this Big Bag is about.
</p><p>
    If you're new to this, there may be a lot of unfamiliar terms and concepts! You may not be sure whether your board or OS layout is <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/ANSI_vs_ISO">ISO or ANSI</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/dustypomerleau/29f5311089767cfbe5915c5743035710">row-staggered or ortho</a> – or something else. And what on earth are dead keys, ergo mods or Extend layers?! Relax and take a deep breath please, because it's all here. I hope you find what you're looking for and then a lot more useful stuff!
</p><p>
    If something is too obscure or hard, look up the community on the Colemak Forum and Discord. We're a right helpful lot! The BigBag is my go-to reply to many questions on the Discord and elsewhere, to the extent that a meme was created in my honor. Be warned...!

    <b><a href="https://colemak.com/">Colemak</a></b> is a wonderful keyboard layout that I and many others use daily with great enthusiasm. It may – and in all likelihood, it will! – make you a faster typist, although you can get very fast with other layouts too. More importantly, it makes typing a lot more comfortable and optimal, and your fingers will thank you for the rest of your life for choosing it!  ♪～╰(＊°▽°＊)╯～♪
</p><p>
    Since I started using using Colemak in early 2007 I've been fiddling with it, trying out ideas from the <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/">Colemak forum</a> and adding some of my own. Colemak <i>per se</i> is to me only the letter block mappings. I've always ended up with that mostly intact and it has stood the test of time: Even though the Colemak-DH mod has a lot of traction these days, it's still just a minor adjustment to vanilla Colemak and I consider them the same basic layout at heart. If you look at the ergonomic mods described here you'll see that I'm somewhat flexible about geometry – but in reality that's about the physical keyboard design and a better hand position. The layout itself stays essentially the same.
</p><p>
    And so, <i>voila</i>, here it is! Have a look inside the Big Bag and see what you'll find!  ( のvの) c[_]

<h3>HOWS</h3>
<p>
    Throughout the pages, select one of the four platform icons to see implementation-specific info in these boxes.

    <p>
        I use my own edition of Farkas Máté's excellent Portable Keyboard Layout – EPKL – to implement the Big Bag for Windows. For Linux, I've hacked up a bunch of modifications to the X.Org XKB files. Then I got me a USB-2-USB "QUICKIE" converter and implemented much of my tricks for that too; they should work for most programmable controllers. I'm pretty proud of it all, I must say! :)
    </p><p>
        An advantage with my implementation is that in most cases you can pick and choose most of the enhancements as modules:<br>
    <ul class="disc">
        <li>The Angle/Wide ergo mods are models/remaps so they work with any layout you choose (including QWERTY or Dvorak ones) and may be chosen per user</li>
        <li>The Extend layers and their switch key are options that should work with nearly any existing layout</li>
        <li>The locale/phonetic, Mirrored and Tarmak layouts are separate layout variants</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
        Freedom of choice through modularity is an ideal in the DreymaR world, as it is in Linux.

        <h3>DONE:</h3>
        <ul class="disc">
            <li>Get the Big Bag implementations (Win/EPKL, Linux/XKB, Controllers/TMK) up and going as GitHub repositories.</li>
            <li>Present the Big Bag more hypertextually on GitHub web pages with a colemak.org address (still Work-In-Progress).</li>
            <li>Updated Rulemak and Bulmak to 2016 versions (<b>ru/by/ua, bg/rs/mk</b> – although only found in <b>ru</b> and <b>bg</b> so far): <br>
                East Slavic (Russian/Church/Belarus/Ukraina?) & South Slavic (Bulgarian/ISO-9/Serbia(Cyrillic)/Macedonia?)</li>
            <li>Tarmak layouts for Curl-DH modders. The changes are minor, but should be easily accessible for the newcomer.</li>
            <li>Training topic: Alternative fingering. Tricks like sliding in for the NK/KN bigram are useful for the somewhat advanced typist.</li>
            <li>Transition from DHk (the 2017 standard) to DHm (SteveP's original DH mod) as the Colemak-DH standard</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Modifier keys for 4 Extend layers. For instance, Caps+{--, RShift, RAlt, RShift+RAlt}. Holding down Caps maintains the layer state.</li>
            <li>"Tap dance sequences", using dead keys and/or combines to release strings and things without having to hold modifier chords.</li>

            <li>Also an Arabic phonetic Colemak variant, building on the same principles as the Hebrew one.</li>

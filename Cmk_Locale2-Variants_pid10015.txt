[h]LOCALE COLEMAK[eD] VARIANTS[/h]

In the following I've described how to make a set of locale layouts for many languages, remapping for the most part the bracket keys (LBr/RBr) and the "lesser/greater" key (LSGT, also known as VK_102). If more keys than these are needed, the KHLJ keys with AltGr (lv3-4 mappings) are also available in my layout since they hold nonessential mappings beforehand and are placed together. This is what I call 'Universal Symbols' variants. I also provide 'Keep Local Symbols' variants where all the non-letter keys behave as locale users are used to – but at the cost of whatever nifty Colemak[eD] mappings were on those keys! This includes all dead keys as I've put those solely on symbol keys.

In the below, the 'keep local symbols'/'ks' variants are shown without any WideAngle ergonomic mods to avoid confusion to newcomers. The 'universal symbols'/'us' variants however, are shown as cutouts from a WideAngle modded keyboard as all the "fluid" keys are bunched together in the middle on such a board. Both variant types may of course be used with wide or non-wide setups at your leisure.

There's quite a bunch of these now! I can make more on request or whim. It'd be nice with feedback from local users as some design decisions are open to debate and depend on actual usage as well as personal preferences.

Here's what I've covered so far, providing both conservative 'keep local symbols' and my preferred 'unified symbols' variants
(On a side note, there are but 11 Dvorak layouts so now Colemak really has wind in its locale sails!):

The '[eD] unified symbols' solution for [b]al[/b]:
• Çç, while also present at AltGr+Kk, can have the same key as in the local layout (LBr). I put Ëë next to it.

[h][ba hr rs si] BOSNIAN (BOSNIA), CROATIAN (CROATIA), SERBIAN (SERBIA), SLOVENIAN (SLOVENIA)[/h]

The Bosnian/Serbocroatian/Slovenian layouts are almost identical, differing mostly in how they handle some dead keys (on ~/1/3/5/7/- ).
They need Đđ, Ćć, and the caron letters Čč/Šš/Žž. Some variants also include NJ, LJ and DŽ digraphs, but the default ones do not.

The '[eD] unified symbols' solution for [b]ba hr rs si[/b]:
• A caron dead key on LBr takes care of ČŠŽ.
• Stroke D could've replaced the Ðð on AltGr+Dd, but it's too common so it gets RBr.
• As options, instead of the LBr dead key the caron letters ČŽŠ may be placed on AltGr+KHL in addition to LBr.
• Another available option is putting the DŽ/NJ/LJ digraphs on AltGr+HJL for instance.

[h][be ca fr] FRENCH (BELGIUM, CANADA and FRANCE)[/h]

The Belgian, Canadian (international) and French default QWERTY layouts are similar enough that a harmonized 'unified' variant was made for these locales.
This variant should be good for all users of the French and similar languages. One layout to rule them all...

The needed letters for French-type locales are Éé, ÀàÈèÙù, Çç, Œœ. The LBr key has cirkumflex (âêîôû) and umlaut (ëï).
Some [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency#Relative_frequencies_of_letters_in_other_languages]letter frequencies[/url] for French: é 1.90%; à 0.49%; àèù 0.82%; ê 0.23%; ç 0.09% (which is still more than k at 0.05%); œ 0.02%.

The '[eD] unified symbols' solution for [b]be+ca+fr[/b]:
• Going by letter frequencies, é and grave merit their own keys; the other accents are of less critical importance.
• Éé gets its own key (LSGT) instead of an acute dead key since it's quite frequent and only one letter.
• A Çç key is preferable to the cedilla dead key since there's only one letter needed, but lv3-4 is acceptable since it's a rare letter.
• For the other accent needs, dead keys are the best option; some are common enough to merit a lv1-2 placement.
• LBr keeps its dead keys as in the default layout for easier access to the cirkumflex/umlaut letters even though these aren't very common.
• RBr gets the grave dead key on lv1 since àèù together are somewhat frequent.
• The numerosign (RBr lv2) is hardly in use generally (some use an N and the masculine ordinal to produce 'Nº') but in French locales it's used.
• The letter K is very rare in French, but lv1-2 mappings should not be changed unless absolutely necessary!

The '[eD] unified symbols' solution for [b]br+pt[/b]:
• The two Portuguese locales' default layouts have the acute/grave key on LBr (br) and RBr (pt) respectively; that's messy.
• I think that the acute is the more common accent? At any rate, it feels logical to place it on the LBr.
• Tilde is also important and used for more than just ñ in Portuguese (ã and õ at least), and circumflex is also provided.
• The Çç has a prominent placement in the default locale layouts so it gets its own key (not really sure if that's necessary though?).
• The Brazilian ABNT-2 keyboard's extra key gets the ordinal markers º/ª. These are also placed on AltGr+o/O.

The Polish layout has special letters on AltGr+letter mappings; unfortunately, this messes up the Cmk[eD] consistency quite a bit. The 'Unified symbols' variant is recommended.

    [i]Polish 'Keep Local Symbols' Colemak[eD][/i]

The '[eD] unified symbols' solution for [b]cz[/b] and [b]pl[/b]:
• These two locales ended up very similar, with one acute key and one other accent (hacek for cz, ogonek for pl) for commonly accented letters.
• The ů in Czech is hardly ever capitalized in normal text but the Ů is sometimes needed for caps and letter referrals so it's provided (also for consistency).
• The ż in Polish is the only letter using the dot-above accent so it gets a key for itself. I think the AltGr+period dead key is quite easy to hit though...
• The ł in Polish is only available on lv3-4 but I think AltGr+L is an easy reach.

The '[eD] unified symbols' solution for [b]at de[/b]:

• Ää and Öö are harmonized with the Scandinavian layouts.
• For ß only AltGr+s is provided; I think that's very easy to hit though. The capitalized version is there as an option but I hear it's hardly ever used.

[h][dk fi no se] DANISH (DENMARK), NORWEGIAN (NORWAY), FINNISH (FINLAND) and SWEDISH (SWEDEN)[/h]

The Scandinavian languages use the same special letters albeit written differently: Åå Ææ Øø for Danish and Norwegian, and Åå Ää Öö for Finnish and Swedish. Their default layouts are quite similar too, apart from some stupid differences in punctuation placement which fortunately won't cause us any trouble.

The '[eD] unified symbols' solution for [b]dk+no[/b] and [b]fi+se[/b]:
• These locales use the same special letters. The Åå is kept in place; the same position for all the Scandinavian default layouts.
• The Ææ is somewhat more common in Danish and the Øø in Norwegian, but that shouldn't matter much here! Both positions are decent enough.
• The Ää and Öö are placed in harmony with the other Scandinavian (and German!) layouts.

The '[eD] unified symbols' solution for [b]es+latam[/b]:
• For writing Spanish, the tilde is important but only used for Ññ so that letter gets a key for itself.
• Both acute and grave are important accents so they get lv1 placement in a logical fashion on the brackets ("up then down").
• Unfortunately, the Spain and LatAm default layouts have different placement of the acute accent key. That's silly I think!
• The necessary but less common umlaut and circumflex accents are given lv2 placements.
• (One alternative idea from user javix for standard Spanish is to make a single dead key for acute and tilde on the <LSGT> key!)

The '[eD] unified symbols' solution for [b]gb[/b]:
• There isn't really one! The US (English) layout serves the needs of all English-speaking locales to my knowledge (the £ sign is there).
• Using the 'Keep Local Symbols' layout, conservative Brits may find all symbols where they're accustomed to – at the cost of dead keys etc.


[h][is] ICELANDIC (ICELAND)[/h]

Iceland managed to stick with the Þþ and Ðð letters when for instance English lost them and stupidly started writing 'th' instead. ;)
Other than that, they need the Ææ and Öö letters like the other Nordic countries do, but make do without the Åå (as they use Áá instead).
Icelandic uses the acute accent far more than the other Nordic countries (nearly 6% of all letter strokes).
Some [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_alphabet#Letter_frequencies]letter frequencies for Icelandic[/url] are: ð 5.01%; þ 1.59%; á 1.55%; í 1.34%.

    [i]Icelandic 'Keep Local Symbols' Colemak[eD][/i]

The '[eD] unified symbols' solution for [b]is[/b]:
• As the letter frequencies show, the Þþ and especially Ðð are so common that they shouldn't be kept on lv3-4 mappings for this locale.
• Ææ and Öö however, are less common and hopefully AltGr+Aa and AltGr+Tt respectively are easy enough to hit.
• There are several accented letters (Áá Éé Íí Óó Úú Ýý) and some are quite frequent, so a good acute dead key is needed.
• Icelanders tend to write some Danish and Norwegian, so they'll want accessible Øø and Åå (on AltGr+Dd).

If this is accurate, the accented letters are quite rare all in all.
(Note that Wikipedia reported quite different frequencies with àèù far more common than ìò?)

    [i]Italian 'Keep Local Symbols' Colemak[eD][/i]

The '[eD] unified symbols' solution for [b]it[/b]:
• For the Italian layout, several different accented letters are needed but capitalized letters weren't in the default layout.
• Thus, the letters were provided directly as in the default layout. The éè key was kept on LBr and the rest put together.
• The çłñ may be used (for Ligurian and Venetian script for instance) but they're rare so they're on lv3-4 mappings.
• As a good alternative to this direct approach, I'd recommend the Spanish/LatAm layout! It does the same using dead keys.

The '[eD] unified symbols' solution for [b]nl[/b]:
• The Dutch layout is similar to Belgian and other French-type ones but has more use of the umlaut than the circumflex.
• Therefore I didn't harmonize it fully with the French-type layouts but kept the LBr key the way it is in the default layout.
• The acute letter Éé is somewhat common as is Óó; the acute dead key on RBr should be good enough for that.
• The IJ ligature isn't provided in the default layout so it isn't here either; I think it's falling into disuse. The Compose method has it.

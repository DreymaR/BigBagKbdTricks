[h]PHONETIC COLEMAK LAYOUTS[/h]

These scripts generally have their own or latin letters on (Shift+)AltGr mappings, so they don't use the Colemak[eD] lv3–4 layers.

Ideally, I should be able to define phonetic names for the keys corresponding to Colemak so that other 'phonetic' layouts would work automatically, but I think that at least the XKB way of doing that may be too QWERTY-centric for that to work right now.

The phonetic Hebrew is currently a Work In Progress, see below.

The Kyrillic layouts are slightly tricky since Kyrillic script has more letters than latin script; user [user]ghen[/user] has made a nice solution named [url=https://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?pid=13877#p13877]Rulemak[/url]. There are other proposals as well; see the topics linked to in the main post.

   [i]The Colemak phonetic layout for Greek script, simply moving around the keys of the default (here xkb) Greek layout.[/i]

For the phonetic variant of Greek script I mostly moved the keys of their default layouts to a Colemak setup, not changing anything else. This type of layout already exists in QWERTY form, so making Colemak versions isn't too hard.

I made some choices concerning some Greek letters (e.g., Χχ vs Ψψ vs Ξξ), but I consider my solutions useful and intuitive, and supported by at least some transliteration and/or keyboard layout tradition.


[h][IL] HEBREW SCRIPT[/h]

   [i]The proposed/WIP Colemak phonetic layout for Hebrew script based on phonetic Israeli layouts and own work.[/i]

[b]NOTE:[/b] Turns out my first attempt at this was a misunderstanding and as such quite useless as it was based on the Israeli national layout which isn't phonetic after all! [user]Wrapman[/user] and I are working on a new one (the one in the image above), see [url=https://forum.colemak.com/post/19971/#p19971]the discussion below[/url]!

   [i]The Colemak phonetic layout for Russian Kyrillic script – 'Rulemak' by [user]Ghen[/user]. New (2016) version.[/i]
   [i]Based on KOI-8R, with the notable exception of ч on Colemak H because it's quite common and used in existing phonetic Russian layouts.[/i]

Rulemak is implemented in xkb and PKL (Win) by ghen himself and also ported to my implementations – see the post below!

   [i]The Colemak "Bulmak" phonetic layout for Bulgarian Kyrillic script. 2016 version.[/i]

Both Kyrillic layouts are discussed in [b][url=https://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?pid=13877#p13877]the Rulemak topic[/url][/b]. Notably, ы and ё aren't used in Bulgarian and ъ is more common than ю. Note that in Rulemak, the VK_102/LSGT key is combining acute, whereas in Bulgarian Colemak it's combining grave. Makes some accented letters easy to type.

Personally, I'd love to standardize the X/H == х/ч mappings between Rulemak and Bulmak. But it seems that this won't be easy as Russian and Bulgarian traditions differ too much on this point. Standardization is good, but not at the cost of disuse.

[b]NOTE:[/b] As I understand it, there are East Slavic (Russian/Church/Belarus/Ukraina?) and South Slavic (Bulgarian/ISO-9/Serbia(Cyrillic)/Macedonia?) main language groups (and some others, West and North). Does anyone know whether it'd be sensible to make layouts for Belarus([b]BY[/b]), Ukraina([b]UA[/b]), Serbia([b]RS[/b], Cyrillic) and Macedonia([b]MK[/b]) based on the [b]RU[/b]/[b]BG[/b] layouts, with some small changes if necessary? That'd be awesome! :-)

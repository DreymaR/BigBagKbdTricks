[h]PHONETIC COLEMAK LAYOUTS[/h]

For the phonetic variants of Greek and Hebrew script I merely moved the keys of their default layouts to a Colemak setup, not changing anything else. This type of layout already exists in QWERTY form, so making Colemak versions isn't hard.

Ideally, I should be able to define phonetic names for the keys corresponding to Colemak so that other 'phonetic' layouts would work automatically, but I think the XKB way of doing that may be too QWERTY-centric for that to work right now.

For the Kyrillic layouts it's slightly more tricky since Kyrillic script has more letters; user ghen has made a nice solution named Rulemak. There are other proposals as well; see the topics linked to above.

   The Colemak phonetic layout for Russian Kyrillic script – 'Rulemak' by user Ghen.
   Based on KOI-8R, with the notable exception of ч for H because it's quite common and used in existing phonetic Russian layouts.
   [Note: Rulemak is implemented in xkb and PKL (Win) by ghen himself and ported to my implementations – see the post below!]

   The Colemak phonetic layout for Bulgarian Kyrillic script.
   This layout was discussed in the [url=http://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?pid=13877#p13877]Rulemak topic[/url]. Notably, ы and ё aren't used but ъ is more common than ю.
   NOTE: In Rulemak, the VK_102/LSGT key is combining acute; in Bulgarian Colemak it's combining grave. Makes some accented letters easy to type.

The Curl(DH) mods are an ingenious way of getting the frequent D and H keys to better positions for people who dislike the "middle trench" positions ([i]QWERTY[/i] GH) and feel that this part of the home row doesn't feel quite like home after all! See my [b][url=http://goo.gl/IKR3j]Big Bag topic[/url][/b] or [user]stevep99[/user]'s [url=https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/]DH-mod pages on GitHub[/url] for more info.

Keep your hands at home position ([i]QWERTY[/i] ASDF JKL;) and stretch inwards then down. Which is more comfortable?
    • If you like the inwards stretches ([i]QWE[/i] GH) best, ignore Curl. (Or, try again while keeping your wrists straight as they should ideally be!)
    • If you like the downward curls ([i]QWE[/i] CM) best, consider Curl(DH)!

Curl mods require an Angle mod (see above) to work.

In May 2017, [user]SteveP99[/user], myself and other Curl users agreed on one common Curl(DH) mod, consisting of
    • the D and H positions from the old "mod-DH" a.k.a. the Curl(DHm) mod, and
    • the middle-trench K position from my old Curl(DH) mod, allowing M a better position (at least on standard row-staggered boards).

Here's the Tarmak steps with the unified Curl(DH) mod, shown on an ISO keyboard:

I've split steps 1 and 2 above for clarity. But if you're the careful type you may choose to split them in practice too:

The full Tarmak1-Curl step is a big one which may be scary if you're new to layout switches. If that is the case, consider taking on the normal Tarmak1 step first! The K key will be wrongly placed for the Curl mod, but it's a quite rare key so it shouldn't hurt too much, allowing for a baby-step approach. (In fact, you might then postpone the Hmk switch to whenever you like in the progression, but for sanity's sake I've put it in step 1.)

Similarly, if it seems that a lot is happening in the Tarmak2-Curl step then you may try tackling only the CurlAngle mod (_ZXCVB→XCBV_ in this case) first. In this case, the B gets temporarily misplaced. Several implementations allow you to select the CurlAngle mod separately.


[b]Tarmak-Curl(DH) on ANSI/US keyboards:[/b]

For ANSI/US keyboards, you have to choose an ANSI-Angle mod as these boards don't have the extra key between Z and LShift. The most common one is Angle(Z), which moves Z into the middle where the B used to be as XC move to the left. The Curl mod then arranges B and D as usual:

So again, here's the Tarmak steps with the unified Curl(DH) mod, on an ANSI keyboard with the Angle(Z) mod:

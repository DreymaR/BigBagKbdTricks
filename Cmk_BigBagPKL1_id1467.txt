[h]DREYMAR'S (PKL Win): DreymaR's Extensive Yet Modular AR'Senal (for Portable Keyboard Layout on Windows)[/h]

[i]WARNING - Some Assembly May Be Required (if you want a locale variant that suits you for instance)[/i]

This is the sister topic to my main [b][url=http://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=1438]Big Bag Of Tricks[/url][/b] topic where I discuss the modifications below in detail along with their implementation into Linux (XKB for the X.Org server). In this topic the focus is on PKL implementations of the same "tricks". For a more detailed presentation of any of the topics below, please go to the main [url=http://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=1438]Big Bag[/url] topic. And bear with me for fleshing the Linux topic more out than the Windows one - it's really not about turf wars but about what I'm using most these days.

(Note for Mac users: There's also a topic by user [url=http://forum.colemak.com/profile.php?id=2552]mkborregaard[/url] with [url=http://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=2020][b]Mac implementations of several Big Bag tricks[/b][/url].)

My personal Colemak arsenal now includes several other enhancements (again, also see the main topic linked to above):

[b]†:[/b] For the most part, these files are not premade for Win/PKL (yet) due to the non-modular nature of PKL files.

I use Farkas Máté's excellent [url=http://pkl.sourceforge.net/]Portable Keyboard Layout[/url] ('PKL') to achieve most of the above for Windows.


[h][1.1]    COLEMAK[eD] - EDITION DREYMAR[/h]

My PKL layout.ini file (see links to downloads below) largely corresponds to its XKB counterpart when it comes to the lv3-4(AltGr) mappings. Note that since the Angle/Wide mods aren't modular in PKL I can't deliver all combinations of layout and ergo mod - I myself use both the Colemak[eD] mappings for Norwegian and the AngleWide-Slash/35 mod so that'll be there. I've also included a few others such as the non-Wide standard Colemak[eD] and a bunch of 'virtualkey' layouts that don't have separate lv3-4 mappings. Feel free to add your own; ask if you need help.

My PKL files have separate help images for each state and dead key, with and without Shift (which is quite a lot of images as there are 19 different dead keys now!), that activate when you need them. You can set your own hotkey to show/hide these, or use the default Ctrl+Shift+1. The help image will jump between the top and bottom of your screen if you mouse over it, so as to stay out of the way.


[h][1.2]    EXTEND LAYERS AND THE CAPS SWITCH MODIFIER[/h]

The Extend mappings using CapsLock (or another key of your choice, set in pkl.ini) as a modifier for all sorts of cool moving-keys-around, originated with autohotkey and PKL. I'm very happy with it and consider it a Life Hack on par with Colemak itself! This is one heavy reason I want a PKL implementation of my layout on any Windows PC I work on instead of settling for just a plain Colemak install.

For more info and tricks, see my [url=http://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?pid=16698#p16698]Extend Extra Extreme[/url] topic.

From my pkl.ini file:

[/code]

The PKL implementation of my Extend layer is working fully. It includes sideways wheel scrolling, which the Linux version lacks (it has mousing on/off and a multi key instead). The WheelLeft key is mapped to ISO VK_102 which isn't available on ANSI boards, so if ANSI users want it they'll have to put it elsewhere. One might forgo one Esc key and put the WheelLeft/Right on the bracket keys for instance.

On the Tilde key I but Win+T as a default; it's quite convenient for opening the Taskbar which can then be navigated further with Extend-keys.

[h][1.3]    ENHANCED DEAD KEY MAPPINGS[/h]

This is one area where PKL has one up on XKB (for now)! I've got a "fully functional" set of dead keys with my own mappings on them so they're enhanced beyond pure accents. Also, there are help images that pop up when a dead key is hit.

There are 19 dead keys in my pkl layout right now. The common accents are there, together with a currency dead key on AltGr+4 and a Greek phonetic dead key on AltGr+5. Furthermore, some sparsely populated accent keys have been enhanced with extra content, such as superscripts/subscripts on acute/grave, fractions and negations on stroke/bar and ring symbols on ringabove. The most extensively reworked key is the double-acute which used to have only Uu and Oo and now contains a fairly rich set of math/science symbols (think of the double acute as akin to the equals and prime signs)! You really have to see them to believe them – I'll showcase some below but you can see them all using PKL (default Ctrl+Shift+1 for the help images):

01) Dot below
02) Hook, palatal hook
03) Horn, retroflex hook/tail
04) Currency:

06) Circumflex
07) Caron
08) Ogonek, comma below
09) Breve
10) Ring above, ring symbols:

11) Macron
12) Double-acute, math/science:

13) Umlaut/diaeresis
14) Tilde
15) Acute, superscripts
    [img]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14504410/Keyboards/dreymar/pkl/Cmk-eD_PKL-img_45d/dk15_acute.png[/img]    [img]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14504410/Keyboards/dreymar/pkl/Cmk-eD_PKL-img_45d/dk15sh_acute.png[/img]
16) Grave, subscripts
17) Cedilla
18) Dot above
19) Stroke/bar, fractions
    [img]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14504410/Keyboards/dreymar/pkl/Cmk-eD_PKL-img_45d/dk19_strokebar.png[/img]    [img]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14504410/Keyboards/dreymar/pkl/Cmk-eD_PKL-img_45d/dk19sh_strokebar.png[/img]

Note that the dead keys interact in clever ways: Ring then 'angle' will produce 'arced angle', Tilde with 'equals' will produce 'equal or approximately equal', Stroke with many symbols will produce slashed symbols (e.g., from 'identical to' you get 'not identical to') etc. The sequence you press the dead keys in will usually matter: Start with the modifier(s) (such as dead_stroke for "not") then the symbol-producing key (such as dead_maths and then '=' which will usually produce '≡' but now gives you '≢' instead). At the moment, the only documentation for all this cleverness is snoping around the layout.ini files, but logic will take you far too.


[h][2.1]    THE ANGLE/WIDE KEYBOARD MODEL MODS[/h]

The Angle/Wide ergonomic mods have to be shoehorned into PKL, I'm afraid, as it has no modularity separating key codes from symbols. So I've made edits in the layout.ini file for my Wide mod and also had to make corresponding edits in the pkl.ini [extend] section to make it come together. You could then install both Wide and nonWide layouts and switch between them, but the Extend mappings would only be right for one or the other. And changing stuff is a bit hard. Maybe that's okay with you though.

    [img]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14504410/Keyboards/dreymar/doc/ergomods/Cmk-ISO-Wide35_60d-Finger.png[/img]
    [i]The AngleWide-Slash ('AWide-35') wide ergo mod for PC105/ISO keyboards.[/i]

In the pkl.ini file I have some snippets at the bottom which may be pasted into the [extend] section to implement a wide or non-wide Extend layer. It should be self-explanatory. There are also two template pkl.ini files for wide or non-wide which you could copy and rename to pkl.ini to easily get what suits you.

My help images for PKL are non-Wide only, but do show the Angle mod on an ISO/Euro keyboard. I'm sorry, but making extra images for other setups will be too much work for me! So please see if you can't wrap your head around the provided images even if they may not be exactly the same setup as your keyboard.


[h][2.2]    THE "CURL-DH" COLEMAK ERGO MODS[/h]

I've got some optional mappings in some of the layouts (such as the AngleWide-ISO and AngleWide-No ones) that you may activate by uncommenting their lines and commenting out the original lines. Not very official, yet...

    [img]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14504410/Keyboards/dreymar/doc/tarmak/Tarmak-Curl_Spectral-45d/Tarmak-Curl6_Spectral_Cmk.png[/img]
    [i]The Colemak Curl(DbgHk)Angle ergo modded layout.[/i]

There are now Tarmak steps to learn the Curl(DbgHk)Angle layout gradually should you want to. See below.

The CurlAngleWide modded Colemak I use now, I've dubbed the [ins][b]Colemak-CAW[/b][/ins]! It's a Colemak at heart, but sufficiently modded that I wanted a snappy name for it. It's also a tip-of-the-hat to Billy MacCaw in CATS! ;-)


[h][3.1][3.2]    LOCALE COLEMAK[eD] VARIANTS & PHONETIC COLEMAK LAYOUTS FOR NON-LATIN SCRIPTS [i][TODO][/i][/h]

See [url=http://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=1458]my Locale Variants forum topic[/url] for the various locale solutions!
(Warning: In most cases you'll have to change the PKL files yourself, or ask for help. Notable exceptions are the Rulemak layout for Cyrillic script.)

The locale layouts I've provided are for the most part only a "Latin" layout that can be switched between French/Portuguese/Spanish/Italian by un-/commenting some lines in the layout.ini file, and the Norwegian setup with the AngleWide mod. They usually work for, say, a US keyboard too, but there could be snags with some OEM_ keys (semicolon, slash, tilde, that sort of key). To make your own locale variant you'll want to copy the layout folder for my eD layout over to a new one, renaming it (and putting that new name into your pkl.ini file so the program can choose it!) and then editing the layout.ini file in there.

Only generic ISO help images are provided, as it's too much work to manually generate all the necessary images. I don't have a script like Farkas Máté did.

Example from my layout file showing Norwegian vs standard ISO mappings:
[code]SC010 = Q    1    q    Q    --    ‚    „    ; QWERTY qQ
SC011 = W    1    w    W    --    ‘    “    ; QWERTY wW
SC012 = F    1    f    F    --    ’    ”    ; QWERTY eE
SC013 = P    1    p    P    --    π    ¶    ; QWERTY rR
SC014 = G    5    g    G    --    ŋ    Ŋ    ; QWERTY tT
;SC015 = OEM_4    4    [    {    *{Esc}    å    Å    ; QWERTY [{ ; Cmk-eD_ISO
SC015 = OEM_4    1    å    Å    *{Esc}    [    {    ; QWERTY [{ ; Cmk-eD-No
SC016 = J    5    j    J    --    ʃ    Ʃ    ; QWERTY yY[/code]
Note the following:
• The OEM_4 (Left Bracket) key has scan code SC015 so it's in the middle now; this is the Wide(35/Slash) ergonomic mod in action
• The Norwegian Åå letter on LBr is on lv1-2 mappings due to this being my Norwegian locale layout;
   the only keys that deviate from the standard setup are LBr(OEM_4), RBr(OEM_6) and LSGT(OEM_102).
   (Oh, and the lv3-4 of A because I moved the Ææ to RBr, but that's no biggie)
• On your keyboard these OEM_# numbers might just be different (there's a difference between US/ANSI and Euro/ISO boards); try it out... :o


[h][4.1]    THE TARMAK TRANSITIONAL COLEMAK LAYOUTS[/h]

There's [url=http://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=1858]a main forum topic on this[/url] that you may want to read.

See below for a download of all four steps plus "Tarmak0" (a.k.a. QWERTY) and "Tarmak5" (a.k.a. Colemak).

    [img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14504410/Keyboards/dreymar/doc/Tarmak/Tarmak_Spectral_ETROI.png[/img]
    [i]The 4 Tarmak (transitional Colemak) layouts, spectrally color-coded from red (Tarmak#1) to violet (Colemak).[/i]

These transitional layouts were implemented as VirtualKey ones, so the lv3-4 (AltGr) and dead key mappings you'll get will be the same as on your installed keyboard layout in Windows. The layouts should support Extend mode fully. If you define several of them in your pkl.ini file, you can swiftly change between them should you wish to.

My pkl.ini files come with lines prepared for Tarmak progressions that you may simply uncomment (commenting out whatever else 'layout =' lines are active there) and start using. You may choose between a progression to vanilla Colemak or to Curl(DbgHk)Angle-modded Colemak. Wide mods are not (yet) available for Tarmak, but they may not be that necessary as you can always go Wide after you've reached the goal.

Help images for each step are now available, and you can see or hide them with the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+1 (configurable in pkl.ini). Holding Shift will show all the steps in different colors.

[h][4.2]    MIRRORED COLEMAK[/h]

I wish for PKL to support multiple Extend modes at some point in the future. For now, I made Mirrored Colemak by replacing the Extend mappings so you can't have both at the same time unfortunately. And that's too bad since it'd be a damn handy thing for one-handed typers!

If you look into the 'Other' folder of my full PKL folder (see link below), there's a partial pkl.ini file there named pkl_mirror.ini; you'll need to copy over the [extend] part of that to your pkl.ini file's corresponding [extend] section. I'm not sure whether the pkl_mirror.ini file is properly updated - let me know if you encounter something odd.


[h][4.3]    "COLEMAKOID" MESSAGEASE LAYOUT FOR TOUCH SCREEN TYPING[/h]

As mentioned, this is mainly for Android/Apple touch screen devices and as such I'll only mention it briefly here. In the [url=http://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?pid=15468#p15468]Colemakoid MessagEase layout topic[/url] you can read more about this wonderful touch screen "keyboard" and my preferred settings for it. Highly recommended for your touch devices!

[h][4.4]    COLEMAK++ HARDWARE REMAPPER USB DEVICE[/h]

Another non-XKB/Win solution, but very interesting. With a USB device that plugs between the keyboard and whatever you attach it to, you get an OS independent solution that can accommodate most of my other tricks! For people having to deal with zealous IT security rules, this may be the only solution short of getting an expensive remappable keyboard. And it could be fun to make yourself!

[h][5.1]    DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL[/h]

Files for Portable Keyboard Layout (PKL) by Farkas Máté can be found here:
[url=http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14504410/Keyboards/dreymar/pkl/PortableKeyboardLayout_DreymaR.zip]My whole PKL install with all layouts and stuff[/url]

This topic is already too long and complex so I can't add a lot of support for PKL here, but basically: 
• PKL runs on Windows (XP, 7/8/10 – except some "secure" dialogs)
• It's portable: Just run it from anywhere! You don't need Install rights, and it doesn't change the Registry nor anything outside its own folders
• You can carry it with you on a USB drive and run it directly from the USB drive, as long as you have Run privileges from that drive; or put it in the Cloud!
• It's compatible with the wonderful [url=http://portableapps.com/]PortableApps format[/url]
• To run PKL with the PortableApps menu, put the PKL folder in the PortableApps folder (e.g., C:\PortableApps) – that's all!
• To run PKL at startup, put a shortcut to pkl.exe (for instance, Alt-drag the program icon to a new location) in your All Programs -> Startup menu folder
• The above will work by user, so you can use your PKL independently of others (but if several users want PKL with different settings you're in trouble...)
• It won't be running at logon but will be if you lock your machine, so I do recommend getting a layout-independent password or learning your password on all layouts you're using!

• There are a couple of pkl.ini files in my download, for Wide/nonWide setups and suchlike. Have a look at them, and rename the one you like best to 'pkl.ini' to use it.
• The file formats (pkl.ini and layout.ini files) are understandable and commented, but not always simple. Proper documentation doesn't exist, unfortunately.


[h][5.2]    PKL TIPS AND TRICKS[/h]
• PKL settings are in the pkl.ini file in the PKL folder, and layout info/settings in the layout.ini file in your chosen layout folder
• You can adjust the size of the help images in the layout.ini file; I've included a few options but anything goes really
    - My help images have a native resolution of 90 dpi which makes them 812×282 pixels
    - If you want smaller images you could use for instance 2/3 or 1/2 of that in both directions
• If you want to use the CapsLock key for something else or use another key for your Extend modifier:
    – Change the value of the 'extend_key =' line in layout.ini
    – You'll have to use the "enumerated" names for keys, such as 'BACK' for Backspace...
    – ...or a scan code such as 'sc00e'.
    – Check the file for more names and info.
• To disable the Extend key, set its value to 'disabled'.
    – This should work for any other key you wish to remove too.
• If, say, you want a Colemak-style Backspace key on your CapsLock, change its mapping:
    – Change the value of the active 'CapsLock =' line in layout.ini to 'BACK    VirtualKey'.
    – Remove the rest of the line or add a semicolon after the value above.
    – If you want PKL to ignore a key instead, just put a semicolon before or delete that line.
    – Make sure you also turn off CapsLock as Extend as described above.


[h]DONE:[/h]
• [b]2014-01-25[/b]: Added ANSI VirtualKey QWERTY+Colemak with the Wide(28) mod
• [b]2014-05-21[/b]: Revamped Tarmak layouts, with better docs, icons, help images etc
• [b]2014-11-06[/b]: Complete help image set for the Colemak-eD_ISO layout, dead key enhancements and Latin locale variants
• [b]2015-06-25[/b]: Tarmak layouts with help images and pkl.ini files for ISO/ANSI; Curl(DH)Angle ergo mods for ISO/ANSI (AngleZ and A-Wing)
• [b]2016-01-27[/b]: Implementation of the Tarmak steps up to and including the Curl(DbgHk) ergo mod, as vk_layouts.


[h]TODO:[/h]
• Whatever I want to do with the layouts and stuff themselves, I'll discuss it in [url=http://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=1438]the main Big Bag topic[/url]
• There's quite a lot that could be done with these files. More locales and help images, both wide and nonwide file sets...
• However, I'll only do any of that if someone really needs help and asks very nicely. ;)
• The main problem is that since PKL definitions aren't as modular as the XKB ones I'd have to make any changes in multiple file sets at once. Ugh.
• I'm actually considering having a stab at the PKL source code to see if I could modularize the images and key codes a bit...
• A better and clearer implementation of both Curl mods (with Colemak[eD] mappings).


[b]Happy tapping!

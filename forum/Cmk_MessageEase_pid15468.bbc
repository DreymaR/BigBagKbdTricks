[h]DreymaR's "Colemakoid" MessagEase layout for touch screen typing[/h]

[b][url=https://www.exideas.com/ME/index.php]MessagEase[/url][/b] is a wonderful touch screen keyboard for its large friendly keys, fast typing and lots(!) of possibilities! The combo of tap mappings for the 9 most common keys and drags between those keys for the other letters/symbols is very powerful. It's very well optimized for speed and ease too – but a bit of a hassle to learn and remember early on. That may be a stumbling stone for the new user.

I've made a "Colemakoid" remapping for the drag positions of MessagEase. This works because the home row in Colemak and other optimized layouts corresponds largely to the tap mappings on the MessagEase keys so the drag mappings are left to be arranged to a pattern familiar to Colemak users. It won't quite work for users familiar only with QWERTY, obviously, but should still be easier to recognize and remember than the default layout since many of the less frequently used Colemak mappings are similar to QWERTY ones. The only downside is that you won't benefit as much from some of the MessagEase teaching Game levels that are based on the default drag mappings.

The horizontal drags were kept for shifted number keys according to the numbers on the keys you drag from: For example, right-drag from 'A' (which is also '1' on the NumPad) corresponds to Shift+1 on a standard keyboard so it gives you an exclamation mark. The diagonal drags are the top and bottom letter rows laid out largely as in the Colemak layout, very visually recognizable. Diacritics are logically placed at the top, and punctuation at the bottom.

I find the layout much easier to remember and learn this way, and I think it should be about as effective as the default centric layout: ≈70% of the action will be on the tap keys anyway, and the diagonal drags are positioned so that the best drags (up/down from the middle column for instance) actually get the more frequent letters in my setup.

I like to type with two thumbs like the fastest MessagEase typists do ([url=http://www.exideas.com/ME/meetOurChamp.php?fbclid=IwAR0Yf0ReoCraAfPV0uRlLylpLGxWnZEW4xnHwGupHSy2663YrrppA1SucCc]ChengWei[/url] at least), but I'm not all that fast myself and my ≈45 WPM is much lower than the speeds of Ghen and Davkol for instance. [Update 2019: I'm at ≈60 WPM now!]† I think Ghen still uses a single finger, so who's to say what's best. It'd be nice if users with different techniques could check out my layout and compare it to the default to get some more opinions on the table.

Should anyone want to try out my Colemakoid MessagEase mappings, they can be imported using the following export code from the app, replete with instructions and all:

That's so clever. :)

This is what you should end up with, but not all mappings are shown on the autogenerated layout exchange image (there's [] {} next to the parentheses for instance). Your imported keyboard should now look like mine which is quite transparent and unintrusive ("stealth mode") as I've learnt where everything is now, but you can of course change the colors and transparency in the settings if you like (along with size, finger tracks and even button roundness!).

Feel free to replace ÆØÅÞÐ etc with something more useful to you (or just hide/disable them to avoid misfires), as MessagEase is easily reconfigurable.

Also remember that there are drag-return mappings as well (sadly not configurable at present), drag-circle/drag-return for quick entry of capital letters, press-and-hold for quick single digit entry, and the wonderful [C] button for a quite rich combine table – press the hand icon for help/info/settings where you can learn more about it. Also, you can make hotstrings, control strokes and more (Ghen has administered servers with it!) – etc etc. All in all, there's such a wealth of options and settings and together they make MessagEase an incredibly nice and powerful touch screen typing tool!

†: Should you want to calculate your WPM speed from the MessagEase Game "World Game" where you type the standard 160 character SMS competition text about piranhas, here's how: If your test time in seconds is T then the WPM speed is (160 C * 60 min/s) / (5 C/W * T s) = [u]1920/T WPM[/u]. So, e.g., a test time of 32 s equals 60 WPM.

[h]DREYMAR'S BIG BAG of KEYBOARD TRICKS – ÞE OLDE PAGES[/h]

The Big Bag is moving! These pages are probably the most complete version of it still, but as time goes by the focus should shift to the new snazzy format at:
[b][url]https://dreymar.colemak.org/[/url][/b]
It's a lot of work to move such a big bag though, so if you're missing something make sure to look in both places before you despair...


[h]THE BIG BAG THEORY[/h]

My mission is to make your keyboard a lot more comfortable and powerful, even if you don't have an expensive programmable board. To this end, I use the Colemak layout with several ergonomic mods and additions that I and others have created over the years, on different OS platforms. These "tricks" are what this Big Bag is about.

If you're new to this, there may be a lot of unfamiliar terms and concepts! You may not be sure whether your board (or OS layout) is [url=https://deskthority.net/wiki/ANSI_vs_ISO]ISO or ANSI[/url], [url=https://gist.github.com/dustypomerleau/29f5311089767cfbe5915c5743035710]row-staggered or ortho[/url] – or something else. And what on earth are dead keys, ergo mods or Extend layers?! Relax and take a deep breath please, because it's all here. I hope you find what you're looking for and then a lot more useful stuff!

If something is too obscure or hard, look up the community on the Colemak Forum and Discord. We're a right helpful lot! The BigBag is my go-to reply to many questions on the Discord and elsewhere, to the extent that a meme was created in my honor. Be warned...!  ( ͡~  ͜ʖ ͡°)

[h]A SHORT CUT TO [s]MUSHROOMS[/s] ... errr ... COLEMAK[/h]
Some just want Colemak for Windows and just want it to work now, without reading up first. I recommend that you browse the contents below to know more about your options! But if you're impatient and would rather come back later to learn about Tarmak or Extend or ergo mods or Colemak[eD] or whatnot, here you go:

This is the [b]Big Bag of Keyboard Tricks Main Topic[/b], in which I go into detail on what my different tricks are.

[b][url=https://colemak.com/]Colemak[/url][/b] is a wonderful keyboard layout that I and many others use daily with great enthusiasm. It may – and in all likelihood, it will! – make you a faster typist, although you can get very fast with many other layouts. More importantly, it makes typing a lot more comfortable and optimal, and your fingers will thank you for the rest of your life for choosing it!  ♪～╰(＊°▽°＊)╯～♪

Since I started using Colemak in early 2007 I've been fiddling with it, trying out ideas from the forum and adding some of my own. Colemak [i]per se[/i] is to me only the letter mappings. I've always ended up with those intact, as Colemak has stood the test of time and experimentation. If you look up the ergonomic mods below you'll see that I'm somewhat flexible about the geometry – but in reality that's about the physical keyboard design and a better hand position for me. The layout itself stays essentially the same!

And so, [i]voila[/i], here it is:

[h]HOWS:[/h]
I use my own edition of Farkas Máté's excellent Portable Keyboard Layout – EPKL – to implement the Big Bag for Windows. For Linux, I've hacked up a bunch of modifications to the X.Org XKB files. Then I got me a USB-2-USB "QUICKIE" converter and implemented much of my tricks for that too; they should work for most programmable controllers. I'm pretty proud of it all, I must say! :) The links to the different implementation topics are at the top.

An advantage with my implementations is that in most cases you can pick and choose most of the enhancements as modules:
• Settings may be chosen per user
• The Angle/Wide ergo mods should work with any layout you choose (including QWERTY or Dvorak ones; the Curl-DH mod is Colemak specific)
• Extend layers and their switch keys are options that should work with nearly any existing layout
• The locale/phonetic, Mirrored and Tarmak layouts are separate selectable layouts
Freedom of choice through modularity is an ideal in the DreymaR world, as it is in Linux.


[h]DONE:[/h]
• Updated Rulemak and Bulmak to 2016 versions ([b]ru/by/ua, bg/rs/mk[/b] – although only found in [b]ru[/b] and [b]bg[/b] so far):
    East Slavic (Russian/Church/Belarus/Ukraina?) & South Slavic (Bulgarian/ISO-9/Serbia(Cyrillic)/Macedonia?)
• Tarmak layouts for Curl-DH modders. The changes are minor, but should be easily accessible for the newcomer.
• Get the Big Bag implementations up and going on GitHub.
• Training topic: Alternative fingering. Tricks like sliding in for the NK/KN bigram are useful for the somewhat advanced typist.


[h]TODO:[/h]
• Transition from DHk (the 2017 standard) to DHm (SteveP's original DH mod) as the Colemak-DH standard
• Present the Big Bag more hypertextually on GitHub web pages (Work-In-Progress)
• Dead keys with currency on AltGr+4, Greek on AltGr+5, tech/math stuff on AltGr+= and IPA++ on AltGr+Shift+numbers(?) [done in EPKL]
• A total of 4 Extend layers: Basic/nav/edit, NumPad++, Coding/etc, Hotstrings – or whatever you like! [done in EPKL]
• Modifier keys for 4 Extend layers. For instance, Caps+{--, RShift, RAlt, RShift+RAlt}. Holding down Caps maintains the layer state.
• "Tap dance sequences", using dead keys and/or combines to release strings and things without having to hold modifier chords.
• Fix the [url=https://forum.colemak.com/topic/1458-locale-colemak-variants-for-several-countries-the-edreymar-way/#p19971]Hebrew phonetic Colemak[/url] ("Hebmak") layout, once we agree on how! (With [user]wrapman[/user] and whoever's interested.)
• Also an Arabic phonetic layout.
• Develop and test a [url=https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2389-vietnamese-colemak/]Vietnamese Colemak[/url] (with [user]IceDryst[/user] and whoever's interested).
• More locale variants: [b]epo[/b] (Esperanto), …? (Any suggestions, or comments on the existing ones?)


[h]LASTLY:[/h]
• Best of luck with Colemak and its many marvelous mods!  ♪～╰(＊°▽°＊)╯～♪
• If you do get stuck, here's a little [b][url=https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2157-joking-around/]light entertainment[/url][/b] to hopefully Shift your mo(o)d. ;-)

[quote="Typealong Clackity"]
Colemak's connected to the ... Curl* mod,
The Curl mod's connected to the ... Angle mod,
The Wide mod's connected to the ... shoulder bones,
And Extend's just wonderful!
